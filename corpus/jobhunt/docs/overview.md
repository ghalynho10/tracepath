# JobHunt

## What it is

JobHunt is a multi user job search web app. A person enters a profile, searches real job listings, sees them ranked with the reasoning behind each ranking shown rather than just a number, clicks through to the real posting to apply, and records that they applied. It is free, with no billing, built for one person's own job search, a few friends, and for recruiters or hiring managers evaluating it as a portfolio piece.

## Why it exists

JobHunt replaces an earlier project, JobPilot, on the author's resume and portfolio. Two audits of JobPilot's real codebase, not just its documentation, found specific and serious defects. A usage limiting database function returned a list of rows, the calling code read it as a single row instead, and every metered action was silently denied for every account for two weeks, a bug that went undetected because every test in the suite mocked the same wrong assumption the code made. Separately, the product's core scoring feature passed every test while returning a nearly constant, meaningless fit score, because no test checked the quality of the output, only its shape.

JobHunt's design answers both problems mechanically rather than by good intentions. Failures are values that the type system forces a caller to handle, never exceptions that can be silently swallowed. Alerting is designed around the rate of failure, not just the count, because JobPilot's outage was correctly classified failure by failure and only looked wrong in aggregate. That design is only partly in place: two of the 26 named operations have an alert, and nothing in the scoring pipeline has one. The fit scoring feature, JobHunt's actual differentiator, is built with a banded rubric, a check by a second model from a different vendor, and an eval harness with expected score ranges, specifically so a repeat of the constant score bug is caught when the harness is run after a change to the scoring prompt or model. The harness is a manual command that spends real money, and it does not run in CI.

## How it is built

One Next.js 16 application, App Router, TypeScript in strict mode, with the entire data path running on the server, no client side calls to the database at all. Postgres, hosted by Supabase, is the database, reached through `@supabase/ssr` with no object relational mapper in between; every query carries the caller's own token, so Postgres row level security, a rule enforced by the database itself, is the real guarantee that one user can never read another user's rows, rather than a check in application code that could be forgotten. The one exception is the kill switch read, which uses the secret key by design, from the only module allowed to build a client with it.

Authentication is Supabase Auth, through OAuth only, Google and GitHub, with no password anywhere in the product. The whole handshake runs on the server, so the pages carrying the sign in controls still ship no client JavaScript. A database level hook refuses to create a second account for an email address that already signs in with the other provider, so somebody who forgets which one they used first reaches their own data rather than a new empty account. Zod validates everything crossing a boundary: external API responses, model output, form input, and environment variables. Failures are values, a discriminated union built only through one function that reports itself to Sentry, tagged with a required severity and a closed set of failure kinds, which is what lets an alert group and count them reliably. Styling is Tailwind CSS v4. Jobs data comes from the Adzuna REST API. Every AI call routes through one thin client that a caller reaches by naming a TIER, never a vendor or a model id: one file maps `ai_scoring` to OpenAI and `ai_check` to Google, so swapping either is an edit to that file alone.

The database is eleven tables. Six hold the user's own data and are keyed off a profile row whose primary key is the sign in user's id, with uniqueness, ranges, pairing rules and per user isolation all written as database constraints and policies rather than as checks in application code. The other five hold the kill switch, the usage budget, and the public demo's results, and carry row level security with no policies at all, so no signed in caller, and no anonymous visitor, can read them directly; the demo page and its refresh route are the only callers, and both reach them through the secret key client. The interface is built from a small closed set of base components over a token layer: colours, a fixed type scale and a three tier page rhythm live as CSS variables in one stylesheet, and the components are the only sanctioned way to render those patterns, which is what stops a page inventing its own spacing or its own idea of a card. Tests run on Vitest as four projects: a free unit suite that needs nothing running, an integration suite driving the real local database with the real policies applied, a serial suite for the few tests that mutate rows every other test also reads, and a paid `eval` project that spends real vendor money and is reachable only by name. They use real dependencies rather than mocks, for a reason the next section explains.

The application is deployed on Vercel and split across three environments: a local Docker based Supabase stack for day to day development, a hosted development Supabase project that every preview deployment reads, and a separate hosted production Supabase project that only the live production URL ever touches. Preview URLs sit behind a Vercel login so nothing half built is reachable and no real personal data can land in the development project. Schema changes are hand written SQL migrations committed to git and applied by GitHub Actions, development on every pull request and production on merge to `main`. A single global kill switch, one row in Postgres, can stop every metered call with no redeploy: it is flipped from the Supabase dashboard, read only through the one module in the codebase allowed to hold the database's most privileged key, and if that read itself fails, the switch is treated as on rather than off.

## Main surfaces

The v1 loop runs end to end on the deployed site, and v1 is complete: a signed in person enters a profile, searches real listings, sees them ranked with the reasoning shown, clicks through to the real posting, and their application is recorded. What follows v1 is covered in `## Current state`.

- `/` — the entry page, and the product's front door. Explains what JobHunt does, shows an example of a ranked result labelled as an illustration, and says plainly which features work today and which are only planned. Public, no session, and it ships no client JavaScript at all.
- `/opengraph-image` — a preview card generated once at build time, so a link pasted into a chat renders as a real product rather than a bare domain.
- `/demo` — a public, no sign in page showing real Adzuna listings scored for real by the real scorer, under two fictional candidate profiles that are disclosed on the page as the only fabricated element. Rows come from a manually triggered, secret guarded refresh (`/api/demo/refresh`) rather than a build time fixture, so the evidence stays real and periodically refreshed rather than hand picked. Exists to answer an objection a fabricated demo cannot: that its examples were chosen to flatter the ranking.
- `/ui-preview` — every base component at every variant, for accessibility and responsive checks. Off unless explicitly enabled, so it never appears in production.
- `/terms`, `/privacy` — public pages written against what this codebase actually stores and actually sends to which companies, not from a template. A typed registry of data recipients and a typed registry of stored fields, each guarded by a test, are what keep the two pages honest as later features add their own outside calls.
- `/sign-in` — the real sign in page, in every environment. Two controls, Google and GitHub, each an ordinary form submit that works with JavaScript switched off. When sign in fails it renders this product's own sentence for what went wrong, above both controls, never the provider's raw error text.
- `/auth/callback` — the return leg of the handshake, which exchanges the provider's code for a session. Every path through it ends in a redirect, so a failed sign in lands on a page that explains itself rather than on an error screen.
- `/go` — the door: the one place that reads a signed in visitor's session on `/`'s behalf, so the entry page itself can keep reading nothing and still stop inviting an already signed in visitor to sign in.
- `/profile` (signed in only, in the navigation) — the profile form, four independently saved sections (identity, skills, work history, preferences), each its own edit state named by a URL search parameter rather than client side toggle state. Where a signed in visitor with no profile row lands.
- `/search` (signed in only, in the navigation) — the product's main screen and where a signed in visitor with a profile lands. A bare visit prefills the form from stated preferences and spends nothing; a search with terms in the URL calls Adzuna once and renders the results immediately, then fills in each card's ranking as it resolves. Every result carries a band, the skills matched in that posting, the skills the excerpt did not mention, a written explanation, and an apply control.
- `/applications` (signed in only, reachable but deliberately not in the navigation) — the applications a person has recorded, read back under row level security. The header carries only `/search` and `/profile`; this and `/health` are reachable by URL alone.
- `/health` (signed in only, deliberately not in the navigation) — no longer where signing in lands; that decision now belongs to the one shared landing rule above. Kept as a diagnostic: it reads the signed in user's own profile row under row level security, proving isolation, and displays the kill switch's live value, proving the deployed app can read a flag with no redeploy.

One command sits outside the web app: `pnpm eval` runs the scoring rubric against a committed set of fictional candidate and posting pairs and reports which fell outside their expected band. It spends real money, so it is never part of `pnpm test`.

## Decisions that shaped it

- One Next.js application on Supabase and Vercel, server first, no object relational mapper, with Postgres row level security as the real multi user guarantee. A monolith is the only pattern that is cheap to build, debug, and operate for one developer with an audience in the tens. See [0001](specs/0001-stack-and-architecture/index.md).
- Failures are values, built only through one function that reports itself to Sentry, never thrown and possibly swallowed. JobPilot's own spec asked for this and it was skipped; a swallowed failure was the direct cause of its two week silent outage. See [0001](specs/0001-stack-and-architecture/index.md).
- Expected failures are alerted on by rate, not by raw count. Every denial in JobPilot's outage was correctly classified as expected, and the absolute count stayed small throughout with only a handful of users, so a volume threshold would have stayed silent for the whole two weeks. That is the design, and it is only partly in place. Two of the 26 named operations have an alert (the usage gate and the kill switch read), and nothing in the scoring pipeline has one. The primary uptime monitor watches a page served from a cache, so it would report the site up with the database down, and the second uptime monitor cannot tell a redirect from a working page. See [0001](specs/0001-stack-and-architecture/index.md) and [observability](observability/README.md).
- Three separate environments, local, a hosted development database every preview reads, and a separate hosted production database only the live URL touches, with previews locked behind a login. This is what makes it structurally impossible for a half built branch to reach real personal data. See [0002](specs/0002-deployment-and-environments/index.md).
- A single kill switch, one row in Postgres, read only through the one module allowed to hold the database's most privileged key, flippable from a dashboard with no redeploy, and treated as on if it cannot even be read. The named risk is uncontrolled API cost on a self-funded project, and stopping it can never wait on a build. See [0002](specs/0002-deployment-and-environments/index.md).
- Every rule the data has lives in Postgres as a constraint or a policy, not in application code. A rule written in the application holds only for the code paths that remember it; a rule written in the database holds for every caller, including a future one nobody has thought of. See [0003](specs/0003-data-model/index.md).
- Tests run against real dependencies, never a mock that encodes the same assumption as the code it is testing. This is the direct answer to JobPilot's two week outage, where every test passed because each one mocked the same misreading the code made. The integration suite drives a real local database with the real policies applied. See [0004](specs/0004-test-foundation/index.md).
- The component API is the enforcement mechanism for the interface, not a style guide people are asked to follow. A hand rolled composition duplicating a base component is a review finding, and one such case, a rounded bordered container built by hand, is caught by the linter. See [0005](specs/0005-design-system-and-ui-foundation/index.md).
- The sign in handshake runs entirely on the server, so the public entry page can carry real sign in controls and still ship no client JavaScript. Both controls are ordinary form submits rather than click handlers, which is what keeps that true. See [0007](specs/0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md).
- A second account for an email that already signs in with the other provider is refused by the database, not by application code, and the refusal fails closed: if the check itself errors it still refuses rather than admitting a silent empty account. The development only password sign in was deleted outright rather than switched off, so no environment is one setting away from accepting a password. See [0007](specs/0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md).
- The front door says only what is true. Nothing appears as working that has not shipped, and no control that cannot work is rendered as a link, so a visitor is never offered something that does nothing. The prototype it was built from failed both tests. See [0006](specs/0006-entry-page-and-link-metadata/index.md).
- Exactly one function decides where a signed in visitor lands, imported by every caller that needs the answer (the door, the sign in bounce, the OAuth callback), so the three never quietly disagree. It reads profile row existence only, never whether that profile is good enough to score against, which is a different question with a different owner. A deep link followed while signed out survives sign in through a request header the proxy echoes, then a query parameter, then a short lived cookie, in that order. See [0008](specs/0008-app-shell-and-navigation/index.md).
- The two legal pages are generated from the same typed facts the codebase already keeps about itself (a stored fields registry, a data recipients registry), rather than written once from a template and left to drift. A test fails the moment a new outside call is added without a matching recipient entry, which is what a later feature's own key addition already trips today. They exist to unblock Google's OAuth console as much as to be honest with a reader: an app stuck in Testing is capped at 100 users for its whole lifetime. See [0009](specs/0009-terms-and-privacy-notices/index.md).
- The profile form is view first, not a wizard filled once: four sections, each its own Server Action, its own edit state, and its own save, so a mistake in one section never risks the other three. See [0010](specs/0010-profile-entry/index.md).
- Every outside job search call passes through one atomic database function first, checking the caller's own weekly count and the app's daily and monthly counts together, in one statement, so a burst of concurrent calls can never slip past a limit that only checked itself once. A cap reached is reported as a successful decision whose answer is no, never as a failure, so a working refusal cannot itself corrupt the failure rate alert built alongside it, this project's first, proven to fire with a real forced test rather than only written down. See [0011](specs/0011-usage-gating-and-kill-switch/index.md).
- Every AI call names a TIER, never a vendor or a model id, and one file holds the whole mapping. A caller asks for `ai_scoring` or `ai_check` and gets back parsed, schema checked output; swapping a vendor is an edit to that one file. The same call shape also keeps a budget refusal and a genuine failure structurally distinct, so the budget working as designed can never corrupt the failure rate alert built over it. See [0012](specs/0012-model-client-router/index.md).
- Search is a Server Component reading its terms from the URL, never a Server Action and never a client side fetch, so a shared `/search?q=...` link is a real, working search. See [0013](specs/0013-job-search-and-results-list/index.md).
- Recording an application must not re-render the page it was invoked from, and this is enforced three separate ways rather than one. A re-render would re-run the search and spend one of a small weekly allowance of outside calls, so the apply control is the one deliberate island of client JavaScript in an otherwise server rendered list. See [0014](specs/0014-apply-redirect-and-application-record/index.md).
- Listings are scored against the 500 character excerpt the job source actually returns, and the wording is built around what that excerpt can honestly support: the second skill list is named "not mentioned in this posting" rather than "missing", because the app cannot tell a skill a posting does not want from one further down text nobody was shown. The list is ranked exactly once, after every score resolves, rather than reordering under the reader repeatedly. See [0015](specs/0015-fit-scoring-with-shown-reasoning/index.md).
- The scorer is held to a committed set of fictional candidate and posting pairs with expected bands, run by a command that spends real money and is never swept into the ordinary test suite. This is the direct answer to JobPilot's constant score bug: a rubric that quietly stopped discriminating would pass every unit test and fail here. It has already earned its place, correcting a committed expectation that turned out to be wrong rather than the rubric. See [0016](specs/0016-eval-ground-truth-set/index.md), [0017](specs/0017-eval-harness-runner/index.md) and [0018](specs/0018-band-anchor-review/index.md).
- Every skill the scorer claims it matched is checked by a second model at a different vendor, against the same posting text and under the same written rule read from one shared constant. A claim the check cannot ground is removed from what the reader sees with a note naming it, and a check that could not run says so rather than passing silently. Checking a model's work with the same model shares its blind spots, which is the same reason this project reviews its own code on a second model. See [0019](specs/0019-cross-vendor-self-check/index.md).
- The public demo shows real Adzuna listings scored for real by the real scorer, under two disclosed fictional candidates, rather than fixture data picked to look good. A fabricated demo cannot serve as evidence the ranking works, because a reader can reasonably assume the examples were chosen to flatter it, and a "sample data" label does not fix that; only scoring real postings for real answers the objection. Rows are refreshed by a manually triggered, secret guarded route rather than written at build time. See [0021](specs/0021-seeded-demo-account/index.md).

A feature's own code lives entirely under `src/features/<feature>/`. Anything two features need to share moves to `src/lib` or, for shared UI, `src/components/ui`.

## Current state

**v1 is complete, declared 2026-09-17.** Twenty two of thirty three features in `docs/scope/scope.md` are done. The foundation (stack, tooling, deployment, data model, test foundation, design system, entry page, sign in with per user isolation, app shell, legal notices) shipped first. Slice 1 added profile entry, usage gating with the kill switch, job search with the results list, and the apply redirect with its application record. Slice 2 added the model client router, fit scoring with the reasoning shown, the eval ground truth set, the eval harness, a band anchor correction, and the cross vendor self check. Two more features, spend visibility and gating polish, and the public seeded demo account, shipped during the v1 push without being required by the completion test; they are grouped as **v1 extras** in the scope rather than counted toward v1.5.

**The loop was driven on production, not only locally.** On 2026-09-10 the whole thread ran on `usejobhunt.dev` against the production database and both real model vendors: a real sign in, a profile entered, a search over real listings, the results ranked with the reasoning shown, and two real applications recorded, one scored `good_match` and one `strong_match`. Before that run, every browser pass over the loop had been against a local production build, which left the deployed path proved only as far as the OAuth handshake.

**What follows v1 is split into two deliberately separate phases, both restructured 2026-09-18.** v1.5 is sequenced immediately after v1 and is exactly four features, in build order: listing data quality (feature 19, first because it already carries two confirmed real world defects and a widened remit), master resume, resume tailoring per job, and profile depth and completeness. v2 holds everything else still open, structured search filters, guided application capture, discard with reason, applications dashboard, auth remainder, product analytics, and company research lite, moved there as a deliberate call rather than a trim: none of the seven are needed by v1's completion test.

What that means concretely: a real person signs in with Google or GitHub on the live URL, fills in identity, skills, work history and preferences, searches real listings, and gets them back ranked into five bands with the skills matched in each posting, the skills its excerpt did not mention, a written explanation addressed to them, and a note wherever a second model at a different vendor could not confirm a claimed match. They click through to the real posting and the application is recorded against their own row. A visitor who has not signed in can see the same kind of ranked output on `/demo`, scored for real against two disclosed fictional candidates. Every outside call, to the job source and to both model vendors alike, passes an atomic budget check first that cannot be slipped past under concurrent load, and a single row in Postgres stops all of it with no redeploy.

1284 unit tests back this, verified fresh this pass, plus an integration suite driving the real local database with the real row level security policies applied, and a serial suite for the handful of tests that mutate rows every other integration test also reads. A paid eval harness has already caught a real error in a committed expectation. Twenty one specs are accepted, all eleven tables in Postgres have row level security forced on, with 23 per row policies over the six holding user data, and the application runs across three environments with two hosted Supabase projects.

**Next** is listing data quality (feature 19), first in v1.5 and marked as needing a decision, so `/architect` runs before any build. Master resume, resume tailoring per job, and profile depth and completeness follow it in that order, each depending on the one before it being live. Feature 20, guided application capture, moved to v2 and is still the first thing that will write to the one table in the data model still unused, whenever it is picked up.

**Deliberately not built**, by design rather than oversight:

- **Billing of any kind.** Rejected outright in favour of usage gating; the product is free and stays free.
- **An end to end browser test runner.** Playwright is the recorded choice and is still not installed, because the one behaviour that genuinely needs it cannot be tested without a running app plus real paid calls. It arrives with the first feature that needs a browser, not as an empty config.
- **Fetching the full job posting.** The job source returns a 500 character excerpt only. Spec 0015 decided to score that excerpt and label the result honestly rather than fetch more. As of 2026-09-18 the deferred item covers two consumers, not one: scoring, and feature 25's resume tailoring, the stronger case, since a resume tailored against 500 characters of company boilerplate is close to useless. The tool, a headless browser this project does not yet run, or a hosted extraction service, is left for feature 25's own design pass.
- **A second check on the written reasoning.** The cross vendor check covers the claimed skill matches only. A fabricated claim living only in the free text explanation is a named, accepted gap.
