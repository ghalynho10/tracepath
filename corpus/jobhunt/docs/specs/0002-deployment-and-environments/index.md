# 0002. Deployment and environments

**Date**: 2026-08-21
**Status**: Accepted
**Updated**: 2026-08-21, after the accounts and projects were set up. The decision is unchanged. What changed is that described values became recorded ones, and one build task was corrected.

## Summary

JobHunt goes live on Vercel with three environments and two hosted databases: local Docker for day to day work, a development Supabase project that every preview deployment reads, and a production Supabase project that only the live URL touches. Previews are locked behind a Vercel login so nothing half built is reachable and no real personal data can land in the development project, which is what finally makes spec 0001's rule about the database agent enforceable. The global kill switch stops being an idea and becomes one row in Postgres, readable only by the one module allowed to hold the secret key, flipped from a dashboard with no deploy, and failing closed when it cannot be read. Along the way this feature fixes a gap the scope did not see: the scaffold's sign in is blocked outside local development, so today there is no way to prove the end to end thread on a real URL at all.

## Requirements

**User stories**:
- As the author, I want a merge to `main` to reach a real public URL, so the portfolio link exists from week one instead of at the end.
- As the author, I want preview deployments reading a separate database, so a half built branch can never touch a real resume.
- As the author, I want one switch I can flip from outside the app, so I can stop spending money in seconds without waiting for a build.
- As the author, I want to know the site is down before a recruiter does.
- As a recruiter opening the link, I want the page to load.

**Acceptance criteria**:

- **AC-1**: A merge to `main` deploys automatically, and the production URL serves the application over HTTPS with no manual step.
- **AC-2**: A push to any branch other than `main` produces a preview deployment that reads the development Supabase project. No preview ever holds credentials for the production project.
- **AC-3**: A preview URL is not reachable without a Vercel login. The production URL is public.
- **AC-4**: Every secret is set per environment in Vercel and none is committed. A deployed build never sets `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION`, so a missing or malformed variable fails the build by name rather than booting into a confusing runtime error.
- **AC-5**: The full feature 1 thread is proved against a real deployed URL, not locally: sign in, the protected layout's session check, a read of one row through the real server client under row level security, and the row rendered. Two different seeded users see two different rows.
- **AC-6**: The kill switch flag exists in both hosted databases, and its current value is displayed on the deployed scaffold check page, read through the secret key client.
- **AC-7**: Flipping the flag in the Supabase dashboard changes what the deployed page shows on the next request, with no deploy and no build.
- **AC-8**: A failed read of the flag is treated as switched on, and is rendered as a visible failure. It is never reported as "off".
- **AC-9**: A query carrying a user's token cannot read the settings row at all, proved against the real database rather than asserted.
- **AC-10**: ~~Password sign in is impossible on production, in both places it is guarded: the sign in page does not render and the Server Action refuses to run. The enabling variable is absent there, both guards fail closed, and neither depends any longer on how a build labels `NODE_ENV`.~~ · **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-30 by spec [0007](../0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md).** Kept rather than deleted, because it was met as written and the reason it stopped applying is worth reading. Feature 7 deleted the password path outright, page and action alike, so password sign in is now impossible in EVERY environment rather than blocked in one, and there are no two guards left to fail closed. The goal is met more completely than the criterion asked for; the mechanism it named no longer exists. What survives from it is the fail closed default itself, which is now the session mint's guarantee (spec 0007 **AC-13**).
- **AC-11**: Migrations reach the hosted databases through CI: the development project on a pull request, production on merge to `main`. A migration that fails to apply fails the workflow visibly and does not silently leave the two projects on different schemas.
- **AC-12**: `main` cannot be pushed to directly. A merge requires a pull request and a green CI check.
- **AC-13**: Sentry receives events from both production and preview, each tagged with its environment and with a release matching the deployed commit, and a stack trace points at real source lines rather than bundled output. A deployed build with no DSN configured fails the build by name rather than deploying with reporting silently switched off.
- **AC-14**: Trace sampling is 1.0 in production and lower in preview, read from validated configuration rather than hardcoded in two files.
- **AC-15**: Sentry quota approaching exhaustion reaches a human before it is exhausted, because binding rule 4's alert going silent is the failure this project is written against.
- **AC-16**: Both ways this app can go dark reach a human. An uptime monitor running outside Vercel watches the production URL and notifies when it stops answering, and Supabase's pause warning emails for both projects arrive at an address that is actually read. The two are not interchangeable: the monitor watches Vercel and will report the site up while a database underneath it is paused.
- **AC-17**: The Supabase MCP server, if connected, is scoped to the development project with `read_only=true` and per call confirmation left on. No production project ref is configured anywhere.
- **AC-18**: A broken production deployment can be recovered by promoting the previous one, and the written procedure states plainly that promoting does not undo a migration.

## Decision

**Chosen option**: Option 1: Vercel git integration, three environments, a separate development database.

Deploy from git through Vercel with `main` as production and every other branch as a protected preview, backed by two hosted Supabase projects (development and production) plus local Docker, with schema delivered by GitHub Actions and the global kill switch stored as a single row in Postgres.

**Implementation skills**: `supabase` (`supabase/agent-skills`, `.agents/skills/supabase/`) · `supabase-postgres-best-practices` (`supabase/agent-skills`, `.agents/skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices/`) · `sentry-nextjs-sdk` (`getsentry/sentry-for-ai`, `.agents/skills/sentry-nextjs-sdk/`) · `sentry-sdk-setup` (`getsentry/sentry-for-ai`, `.agents/skills/sentry-sdk-setup/`)

## Rationale

Reasoning, the four options weighed, the landscape check behind the platform facts, and references: see [rationale.md](rationale.md).

## Feature design

### Environment topology

| Environment | Application | Database | Who can reach it | Sign in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local | `pnpm dev` on `localhost:3000` | Local Supabase in Docker | You | Dev password sign in, enabled |
| Preview | Every branch that is not `main` | Development Supabase project, `us-east-1` | You, signed in to Vercel | Dev password sign in, enabled |
| Production | `main` | Production Supabase project, `us-east-1` | Anyone with the link | None until feature 7 ships OAuth |

Vercel functions run in `iad1` to sit beside both databases. Node 24, matching `.nvmrc` and `engines`. The runtime stays Node, never Edge, per spec 0001.

The development project holds synthetic data only. That is not a promise to keep in mind: it holds because previews are the only deployed surface reading it and previews require a Vercel login, so nobody but the author can enter anything into it. If preview protection is ever turned off, this guarantee and binding rule 7's fifth condition both fail together.

### What is actually provisioned

This section was written before any of it existed. It now records real values. Every line below was confirmed by the engineer on 2026-08-21, in the dashboards or in a browser. Nothing in the build environment can read Vercel or Supabase state directly, so these rest on that check and not on a tool's reading.

| Thing | Value | How it was confirmed |
|---|---|---|
| Vercel project | `jobhunt` | Created from the repository. `jobhunt-app` was free as a project name but its subdomain was already taken, and the two are claimed separately, which is why the shorter name is the one carrying the domain. |
| Production origin | `https://usejobhunt.dev` | Loaded in a browser and served the scaffold. Moved 2026-08-30 from `https://usejobhunt.vercel.app`, which now 308 redirects here. |
| Function region | `iad1` | Set in the project settings, beside both databases in `us-east-1`. |
| Preview protection | Vercel Authentication, standard protection, on | Set in the project settings. |
| Production reachability | Public | Loaded in a private window with no Vercel session. Standard protection does not cover the generated production URL, so AC-3 holds as designed and no custom domain is needed to make production public. |
| Supabase projects | Development and production, Data API set **not** to expose new tables automatically on both | The setting was applied to both. Confirm the region is `us-east-1` on each before task 1 is treated as skippable. |
| Sentry | An organisation and a project | Supplies `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, both DSN values, and the source map auth token. |
| Uptime monitoring | An UptimeRobot account with a monitor on the production origin | Because production is public, the monitor measures the application rather than a protection login page. |
| Variable matrix | Set per environment in Vercel | The table under Configuration required is what was set. |

The one value this section left unconfirmed, the framework prefixed system variable names, was settled during the build on 2026-08-21 against Vercel's own framework environment variables reference. All three (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`) exist for the Next.js framework preset, are populated by the same "enable access to system environment variables" setting, and are documented as available at both build time and runtime. No explicit per environment fallback variable is needed, so task 3's fallback is not exercised. The two URL values carry no protocol scheme, which is why the origin resolver adds one.

### Data model sketch

One new table, plus one existing table gaining a fixture path.

`public.app_settings`, the single row that holds the global kill switch.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `smallint` | not null | `1` | Primary key, with `check (id = 1)`. One row, enforced by the database rather than by convention. |
| `kill_switch_enabled` | `boolean` | not null | `false` | True means every gated call stops. |
| `updated_at` | `timestamptz` | not null | `now()` | Maintained by a trigger, so a flip made in the dashboard is timestamped without anyone remembering. |

Access, deliberately narrow:

- Row level security enabled and forced, with **zero policies**. A table with row level security on and no policy denies every action to every role that respects policies.
- No `grant` to `anon` and none to `authenticated`. Two independent gates, matching the pattern already used by `scaffold_check`.
- **One explicit `grant select` to `service_role`**, the role the secret key authenticates as. This is a correction to the original wording of "no grants", and the reason it matters is that `BYPASSRLS` bypasses policies but not table privileges. Those are two separate checks in Postgres, and only the first is bypassed. With the Data API set not to expose new tables, a newly created table starts with no privileges for any Data API role, so without this grant the one intended reader is refused at the privilege check before row level security is ever consulted.
- The only reader is a client built with the secret key, which carries `BYPASSRLS`. That is exactly the caller binding rule 1 already names.

Why the grant is load bearing rather than tidy up: a refused read is a failure, and invariant 3 defines a failed read as "switched on". A missing grant would therefore not look like a missing grant. It would look like a kill switch stuck permanently on, in a deployed application, with AC-8's visible failure rendering exactly as designed. Task 10 writes the grant and task 11 proves the read by hand before anything trusts it.

Whether Supabase's setting withholds privileges from `service_role` as well as from `anon` and `authenticated` was not confirmable from inside this repository, and the evidence available leaned the other way: the installed `supabase` skill describes the setting as affecting `anon` and `authenticated` only. The grant was written anyway, on the grounds that it costs one line, grants nothing the design did not already intend, and is expensive to diagnose when absent.

**Confirmed on 2026-08-22, and the grant was necessary.** `has_table_privilege('service_role', 'public.scaffold_check', 'select')` returns **false** on the hosted development project, and false locally. `scaffold_check` is granted to `authenticated` only, so it is the table that isolates the question, and the answer is that the setting withholds privileges from `service_role` too. The skill's description is wrong, or at least incomplete, for a project configured this way.

Without this grant the kill switch read would have been refused in production, and invariant 3 defines a refused read as switched on. The switch would have sat permanently engaged with the visible failure rendering exactly as designed, which is the failure this section was written to prevent and which the available documentation would have talked you out of preventing. Invariant 6 is therefore load bearing rather than cautious, and feature 4 inherits it as a real build step on every table.

Two separate mechanisms are in play here and they are easy to run together, so to be explicit: **table privileges** decide whether a role may touch the table at all, and are what the Data API setting governs. **Row level security**, including `force row level security` applying to the table owner, decides which rows are visible once the table is reachable. Postgres checks privileges first. Fixing one never resolves the other, which is why task 10's statement order and task 10's grant are two independent corrections rather than one.

`public.scaffold_check` is unchanged. Its rows carry a foreign key to `auth.users`, which is why the fixture reaches hosted projects the way described below rather than through a migration.

### How the scaffold fixture reaches a hosted project

This amends the interview answer, and the reason is a constraint the question missed: a `scaffold_check` row cannot exist without an owning user, and creating fake users in production through a migration would be a worse outcome than the problem it solves.

- **Schema** reaches every project through migrations, always.
- **The `app_settings` row** is inserted by its own migration, so it exists in every project including production. It has no foreign key and nothing fake about it.
- **The `scaffold_check` fixture and its two seeded users** stay in `supabase/seed.sql`, made idempotent, and the migration workflow applies that file to the **development project only**, never production. Production carries no fake users and no scaffold row, which is correct: production has no sign in path at all until feature 7, so the thread is proved on a preview against the development project.

The seed is applied with `psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL_DEV" -f supabase/seed.sql`, a direct connection using a stored connection string, because `supabase db push` does not run seed files. `supabase db reset --linked` would run it but wipes the database first, which is not acceptable against a shared project even a development one.

Whether that insert is actually permitted on a hosted project is unconfirmed, which is why build task 5 proves it by hand before task 6 puts it in CI. The reasoning is in [rationale.md](rationale.md), under why the fixture is seeded rather than migrated.

### Site URL: two values, two jobs

| Value | What it is | Where it comes from | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical site URL | Always the production origin, in every environment | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, validated in `src/env.ts` | Page metadata, canonical links, the social preview image (feature 6) |
| Current origin | The origin this request is actually being served from | A resolver: the branch URL on a preview, the canonical site URL in production, `http://localhost:3000` locally | OAuth redirect callbacks (feature 7), any absolute link back to the running deployment |

Neither can quietly stand in for the other. A canonical link that points at a preview is wrong; a redirect that points at production from a preview is broken.

### API surface

No new HTTP endpoint. Binding rule 6 forbids route handlers under `src/app/api/` from touching user data, and nothing here needs one: the uptime monitor watches the public marketing page, which is a truer signal than a route that only reports on itself.

| Surface | Method | Key inputs | Key outputs | Auth | Key errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/` (marketing page) | GET | none | The page | public | none; a non 200 is what the uptime monitor reports on |
| `/health` (scaffold check) | GET | session cookie | The user's row, plus the kill switch value and its `updated_at` | authenticated, session verified in the protected layout | no session redirects to `/sign-in`; a database failure renders a visible failure block |
| `readKillSwitch()` in `src/lib/kill-switch.ts` | server function | none | `Result<{ enabled: boolean; updatedAt: string }>` | secret key client, server only | `database_unavailable`, `record_not_found`, `response_malformed`, each returned as a failure meaning "switched on" |

### Value sourcing

| Action | Value produced or displayed | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Any deployed request | Which environment this is | `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, parsed as an optional value in `src/env.ts`; absent means local |
| Page metadata (feature 6) | Canonical site URL | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, set to the production origin in all three environments |
| OAuth callback (feature 7) | Current request origin | Resolver: `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` on a preview, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in production, `http://localhost:3000` locally. None of these carry a protocol scheme except the last, so the resolver adds `https://` |
| Sentry init | Environment tag | `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, defaulting to `development` |
| Sentry init | Release identifier | `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` |
| Sentry init | Trace sample rate | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`, validated as a number between 0 and 1, defaulting to 1 |
| Scaffold check page | The user's row | `public.scaffold_check`, through the request scoped server client under row level security |
| Scaffold check page | Kill switch state and when it changed | `public.app_settings.kill_switch_enabled` and `.updated_at`, through the secret key client only |
| Kill switch read failure | What the app assumes | Not a value read from anywhere: a failed read is defined to mean switched on |
| Kill switch read failure | What the page renders | The failure's own `message` and `kind` from `Result`, rendered as a visible failure block that says the value could not be read. It must not render as a plain "switched on", because a deliberate flip and a broken read would then look identical on screen, which is the one distinction AC-8 exists to preserve |
| ~~Dev sign in guard, page and action alike~~ The test layer's session mint | ~~Whether password sign in is permitted~~ Whether a session may be minted | `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED`, a validated server variable defaulting to false. **Amended 2026-08-30 by spec [0007](../0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md)**: feature 7 deleted the password sign in outright, page and action alike, so the guard this row named has no subject left. AC-13 gives the variable exactly one remaining job, guarding the mint in `test/helpers/admin.ts`, and nothing under `src/` reads it at all. Feature 7's own privileged test path, the direct Postgres connection in `test/helpers/database.ts`, deliberately does NOT reuse this variable and takes its own `TEST_DIRECT_DB_ENABLED` instead, precisely so that one job stays literally one |
| Migration workflow | The development database connection for the seed step | `SUPABASE_DB_URL_DEV`, a GitHub secret holding the pooler connection string |
| Migration workflow | Which project to push to | `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_DEV` or `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_PROD`, chosen by the triggering event, from GitHub secrets |

### Key invariants

1. **Destructive migrations are asymmetric.** A migration may add in the same commit as the code that uses it. A migration may drop only after a previous deploy has already stopped reading the thing being dropped. Never add and drop in one commit. Vercel and GitHub Actions build the same commit in parallel, so an additive migration arriving late causes a brief visible error that self heals, while a drop arriving early breaks running code with nothing to catch it. Feature 4 owns the real schema and must carry this rule in its own spec, not inherit it by memory.
2. **`SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` is never set on a deployed build.** It exists for the CI job that holds no secrets, and nowhere else.
3. **The kill switch fails closed.** Anything other than a successful read of `false` means gated calls stop.
4. **Only `src/lib/kill-switch.ts` reads `app_settings`,** and it is the module that holds binding rule 1's named kill switch caller. Pages under `src/app` reach it through that module and never import `src/lib/supabase/secret.ts` directly, which is what the existing lint rule enforces.
5. **Production and development schemas are the same schema.** Both come from `supabase/migrations/`. A change applied to one project by hand is drift, and the workflow is the only sanctioned path.
6. **Every new table is granted explicitly.** Neither project exposes new tables to the Data API automatically, so a table is reachable only by a role named in a `grant`, and the role granted has to match the client that reads it. This is a build step on every table from now on, never a default to lean on. Getting it wrong produces a permission denial rather than an empty result, which is the failure shape this project wants, but only if someone recognises it as one.
7. **No secret is ever committed.** `.gitignore` already excludes every `.env*` except the template; `.env.example` stays the complete record of what has to be set.

### Security model

- **Preview deployments**: Vercel Authentication, standard protection. Only the account owner reaches them. Production stays public, and that is a checked fact rather than an assumption: standard protection leaves the generated production URL reachable with no Vercel session, confirmed in a private window on 2026-08-21. Raising protection to cover all deployments would take production private and break AC-1, AC-3 and the uptime monitor in one move.
- **`app_settings`**: unreadable and unwritable by any user token. Readable by the secret key client, which is constructible in exactly one file. Writable in practice only through the Supabase dashboard or a direct database connection, which is the point: flipping the switch requires access to the deployment, not a privilege inside the product.
- **`scaffold_check`**: unchanged, one row per user under an ownership policy, `anon` deliberately ungranted so a request without a session gets a hard denial rather than an empty result.
- **Dev password sign in**: enabled by an explicit variable that defaults to false, set only on the Vercel Preview environment and locally. Production never carries it. Feature 7 deletes the whole feature folder.
- **Supabase MCP**: scoped with `project_ref` to the development project, `read_only=true`, per call confirmation on, no other MCP server connected alongside it, and the production ref configured nowhere. This closes the environment half of binding rule 7 that spec 0001 assigned to this feature.
- **Personal data**: none in the development project by construction, since previews are the only surface that reads it and they require a Vercel login.

### Configuration required

Set in **Vercel**, per environment. Nothing here is committed.

| Variable | Production | Preview | Local `.env.local` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | production project | development project | local Docker | Supabase endpoint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | production project | development project | local Docker | Browser safe key |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | production project | development project | local Docker | `sb_secret_…`, read only by `src/lib/supabase/secret.ts` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://usejobhunt.dev` | `https://usejobhunt.dev` | `https://usejobhunt.dev` | The canonical URL, same everywhere by design. Moved 2026-08-30 |
| `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED` | **not set** | **not set** | `true` | Guards the test layer's secret key client in `test/helpers/admin.ts`. Defaults to false. **Amended 2026-08-29 by spec [0007](../0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md)**: it used to enable the development password sign in, which feature 7 deletes, and it used to be set on Preview. Nothing deployed reads it now, and CI sets it on the test jobs itself, so a value set where nothing reads it would be its own small untruth |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | `1` | `0.1` | `1` | Binding rule 4 needs 1.0 where the ratio alert runs; previews must not compete for that quota |
| `SENTRY_DSN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | **required** | **required** | optional | Required on any deployed build, optional locally so a fresh clone still runs |
| `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | set | set | unset | Build time only, for source map upload |
| System environment variables | enabled | enabled | n/a | Provides `VERCEL_ENV`, `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` and their framework prefixed forms |

New entries in `src/env.ts`, all parsed by Zod like everything else:

- `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED` (server, boolean from string, default `false`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (client, URL, required)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (client, number between 0 and 1, default `1`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` (client, all optional, absent when running locally)

One change to existing entries: `SENTRY_DSN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` stop being plainly optional. They become **conditionally required**: optional when `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` is absent (local work, and a fresh clone before anyone has a Sentry project), required when it is present. Without this, a deployed build with no DSN succeeds and ships with error reporting silently off, which is the failure shape the whole error model exists to prevent, and it would leave AC-13 passing on paper while nothing reported.

Set as **GitHub Actions secrets**, for the migration workflow only:

- `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: a personal access token for the Supabase CLI
- `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_DEV`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID_PROD`: the two project refs
- `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_DEV`, `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD_PROD`: the two database passwords, used by `supabase db push`
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL_DEV`: the development project's connection string, used only by the seed step

**Prerequisites before coding begins**, each producing values the build then needs. **All four are satisfied as of 2026-08-21**, and the values they produced are in the table under What is actually provisioned. They are kept here rather than deleted, because a later reader needs to know what this feature depended on and did not create.

- A Vercel account (confirmed to exist). **Satisfied**: project `jobhunt`, region `iad1`, preview protection on.
- Two Supabase projects in `us-east-1`, development and production. Each yields a project URL, a publishable key, a secret key, a project ref, a database password and a connection string. **Satisfied**, both created, both with the Data API set not to expose new tables automatically. Confirm the region on each before skipping task 1.
- A Sentry account with an organisation and a project. Yields `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`, the DSN, and an auth token for source map upload. Nothing in this feature creates these, and four required variables come from them. **Satisfied**.
- A free uptime monitoring account. **Satisfied**, UptimeRobot, with a monitor already pointed at the production origin.

### Critical test scenarios

- Happy path: a merge to `main` deploys and the production URL serves the marketing page, verifies **AC-1**.
- Happy path: on a preview URL, signing in as `dev-one` shows dev one's row, and signing in as `dev-two` shows a different row, verifies **AC-5**.
- Failure case: with `app_settings` unreachable, the deployed page renders a visible failure and the app treats the switch as on, verifies **AC-8**.
- Failure case: flip the flag in the dashboard, reload the deployed page, and the displayed value changes with no deploy, verifies **AC-7**.
- Failure case: a migration written to fail is pushed, and the workflow fails visibly rather than reporting success, verifies **AC-11**.
- Auth/permission: a query with a signed in user's token against `app_settings` returns a permission denial, not an empty result, verifies **AC-9**.
- Auth/permission: an anonymous request to a preview URL is stopped by Vercel Authentication, verifies **AC-3**.
- Auth/permission: ~~a POST to the sign in action on production is refused because `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED` is absent, verifies **AC-10**~~ · **UNRUNNABLE SINCE 2026-08-30**, and see AC-10 above. Spec [0007](../0007-auth-and-per-user-isolation/index.md) deleted the Server Action this scenario posts to, so there is nothing left to refuse. Struck rather than rewritten because the property it tested, that no environment can accept a password, stopped being a guard and became structural: the code path does not exist. Spec 0007's own `verify.md` greps for its absence instead.

## Build plan

Ordered as a Tracer Bullet: get one thin thread serving from a real URL before thickening any part of it. Tasks 1 to 4 are the thread; everything after widens it.

1. **Already created, so record and confirm rather than create.** Both Supabase projects exist, development and production, each with the Data API set not to expose new tables. Confirm both are in `us-east-1`, then record, for each: project URL, publishable key, secret key, project ref, database password and connection string. Task 3 and task 5 both need these, not just the refs. Satisfies **AC-2**.
2. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` and the three optional Vercel system values to `src/env.ts` and `.env.example`, and make the two Sentry DSN values conditionally required as described above, so a missing variable fails the build by name before any deploy exists to be confused by it. Satisfies **AC-4**, **AC-13**.
3. **Already created, so verify rather than create.** The Vercel project `jobhunt` exists from the GitHub repository, with production branch `main`, Node 24, system environment variables enabled, functions in `iad1`, and the variable matrix set per environment. Check each of those against the configuration table above, check that `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION` is set nowhere, and correct whatever does not match rather than assuming it does. While in the dashboard, settle the open question about variable names: confirm the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_*` names actually reach the client bundle, and if any does not, set an explicit variable per environment in its place and say so here. Satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-4**.
4. **Already on, so verify rather than turn on.** Vercel Authentication is set to standard protection. Confirm both halves of what that means here, since the whole environment split rests on it: a preview URL in a private window asks for a login, and `https://usejobhunt.vercel.app` in a private window does not. Satisfies **AC-3**.
5. **Prove the seed's write path by hand against the real development project, before any of it goes into CI.** The migration creates `scaffold_check` as `postgres`, so `postgres` owns it, and it forces row level security with no insert policy. A table owner under `force row level security` does not bypass policies unless its role carries superuser or `BYPASSRLS`. The local Docker `postgres` is a superuser, so this can never surface locally; whether the hosted `postgres` role carries `BYPASSRLS` is unconfirmed. Run the seed manually once the project exists. If it is refused, the fix is small (insert the rows through the secret key client, or add a narrowly scoped insert policy), but finding out through a red required check on an unrelated pull request is the expensive path. Satisfies **AC-5**, **AC-11**.
6. Add `.github/workflows/db-migrate.yml`: `supabase db push` to the development project on `pull_request` (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`), to production on a push to `main`, failing the run visibly on a failed migration. Make `supabase/seed.sql` idempotent and apply it to the development project only, in the same workflow, with `psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL_DEV" -f supabase/seed.sql`. Correct that file's header comment while you are in it: it currently reads "Local development seed. Runs on `pnpm db:reset`, never against a real project", which this workflow makes untrue.

    A failing seed step fails the workflow, the same as a failing migration. That is deliberate, and it is the second way this workflow can turn an unrelated pull request red, alongside a paused development project. Accepted for the same reason: a seed that silently stopped applying would leave the development project without the two users AC-5 is proved with, and the next person to run task 9 would debug the wrong thing. Satisfies **AC-11**.
7. Replace the `NODE_ENV` guard with the validated `DEV_SESSION_ENABLED` check, failing closed, in **both** places it lives: `src/features/dev-session/actions.ts` and the page guard in `src/app/(marketing)/sign-in/page.tsx`. Fixing only the action leaves the sign in page returning a not found on every preview, so the thread stays unreachable and AC-5 cannot be run. Satisfies **AC-10**.
8. Add the current origin resolver beside the canonical site URL, so features 6 and 7 have both values named and neither has to be invented later. Satisfies **AC-5**.
9. Re run the whole feature 1 thread against a real preview URL as two different users, and record the steps in `verify.md`. Satisfies **AC-5**.
10. Add the `app_settings` migration, **in this statement order, because the order is the correctness**: the table, the single row check, the `updated_at` trigger, then the `insert` of the single row, then `enable row level security`, then `force row level security` with no policies, then no grant to `anon` and none to `authenticated` and one explicit `grant select on public.app_settings to service_role` for the reason given in the data model sketch.

    The insert comes **before** `force row level security` deliberately. Forced row level security applies to the table owner too, and a table with policies forced and zero policies denies an insert to any role that respects them. Whether the hosted `postgres` role carries `BYPASSRLS` is the same unconfirmed thing task 5 exists to settle, so a migration that forces first and inserts second could be denied on its first application to both hosted projects while passing locally, where `postgres` is a superuser. Ordering it this way removes the question instead of betting on the answer.

    Then, in the same sitting and before task 11 trusts anything: check what privileges `service_role` actually holds on the new table (`select has_table_privilege('service_role', 'public.app_settings', 'select')`). This settles whether the Data API setting withholds privileges from `service_role` at all, which decides what a denial in task 11 means. Also run AC-9's proof here rather than leaving it to a test scenario with no owner: query `app_settings` with a signed in user's token and confirm a permission denial rather than an empty result, and record the result in `verify.md` the way task 9 records its run. Satisfies **AC-6**, **AC-9**.
11. Add `src/lib/kill-switch.ts` reading the flag through the secret key client, opening the `kill_switch.read` span as its first statement, parsing the row with Zod, and returning a failure that means switched on. Register the span in `docs/observability/spans.md`.

    **The module must check the returned `error` field itself.** `attempt()` converts a thrown exception, and only a thrown exception, per its own doc comment in [src/lib/result.ts](../../../src/lib/result.ts). The Supabase client does not throw on a permission denial or a missing row; it returns `{ data: null, error }`. So wrapping the call in `attempt()` and reading only what comes back would let a denial arrive as a success carrying `null`, which Zod would then reject as `response_malformed`. The right shape is: `attempt()` for a genuine transport throw, an explicit check of `error` mapped to `database_unavailable`, an explicit check for no row mapped to `record_not_found`, and Zod for a row that parses wrong. Three named kinds, three real causes, rather than one misleading one.

    **Then prove the read by hand against the real development project before anything trusts it**, the same way task 5 proves the seed's write path. A successful read of `false` means the privileges are right. A denial means one of three things, which is why task 10 checks the privilege first: the table grant is missing, `service_role` lacks `usage` on schema `public` (a `select` grant without schema `usage` still denies), or the key in the environment is not what it is believed to be. Without task 10's check, a denial here looks the same in all three cases, and the switch would read as permanently engaged while every visible signal looked exactly as designed. Satisfies **AC-6**, **AC-8**.
12. Render the flag's value and `updated_at` on the deployed scaffold check page, then prove a dashboard flip changes it with no deploy. Satisfies **AC-6**, **AC-7**.
13. Wire Sentry per environment: environment tag, release from the commit sha, sampling from the validated variable, source map upload in the Vercel build. Satisfies **AC-13**, **AC-14**.
14. Turn on Sentry's quota notifications and record the threshold in `docs/observability/README.md`, alongside a note that a silent rate alert is the failure mode this protects. Satisfies **AC-15**.
15. **Monitor already created, so confirm and record rather than set up.** The UptimeRobot monitor watches the production origin, which is public, so it measures the application and not a protection login page. Confirm that against a real check result rather than the settings page, then record it in `docs/observability/README.md` together with the two things it does not cover: it watches Vercel, so a paused database leaves it reporting the site up, and it would report a protection login page as up too if protection were ever raised to cover production. Satisfies **AC-16**.
16. Confirm Supabase's pause warning emails reach an address that is actually read, for **both** projects, and record in `docs/observability/README.md` that this, not the uptime monitor, is the pause detection mechanism. Satisfies **AC-16**.
17. Protect `main`: pull request required, CI check required. Satisfies **AC-12**.
18. **A human step, not a `/develop` step.** Connect the Supabase MCP server scoped to the development project with `read_only=true` and per call confirmation, and confirm no production ref exists in any configuration. MCP authorisation needs an interactive session (`claude mcp` or `/mcp`) and cannot be completed inside an ordinary build pass, the same constraint spec 0001 already records for the Vercel MCP server. Satisfies **AC-17**.
19. Correct spec 0001's binding rule 1 allow list and the matching comment in `src/lib/supabase/secret.ts`, so both say the kill switch read is built in feature 3 and lives in `src/lib/kill-switch.ts`. Binding rule 1 says its allow list is closed and changing it means editing the spec, so this is an edit the rule itself requires, not a tidy up to defer. Satisfies **AC-6**.
20. Write the rollback procedure into `docs/observability/README.md`: promote the previous deployment first, revert in git after, and note plainly that promoting does not undo a migration. Satisfies **AC-18**.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- A real public URL exists from week one, which is what features 6 and 7 were sequenced against and what makes the portfolio claim real rather than pending.
- Binding rule 7's fifth condition becomes enforceable, so the Supabase MCP server can be connected without dropping one of its five conditions.
- The kill switch exists before the first external call, which is the ordering the named risk rule asks for.
- A gap the scope did not see is closed: the deployed leg of the feature 1 thread was unprovable, and is now provable.
- Both hosted environments are free. Nothing here introduces a monthly bill.

**Negative and tradeoffs**

- Two hosted projects means two sets of secrets and a schema that can drift if anyone applies a migration by hand. The workflow is the mitigation; the discipline is still a discipline.
- **Both hosted projects will pause, and production is the more exposed of the two.** Supabase's free plan pauses a project that has not had sufficient database activity over the previous week, and their guidance is that this means roughly a few user requests a day across that week. That is a daily bar, not a weekly one, so a burst of activity on merge day does not clear it. Production is worse off than development here: nothing touches the production database at all until feature 7 ships a way to sign in, so it will pause while being perfectly healthy. Development is exposed too whenever a few days pass with no previews.

  The consequences differ by project. A paused **development** project first breaks **CI**, not previews: the migration workflow's push fails, and with `main` behind a required check, an unrelated pull request goes red for a reason that does not look like the cause. A paused **production** project leaves the marketing page serving normally while anything touching data fails, which is precisely the shape of failure this project's error model exists to make visible.

  Detection is Supabase's own email, not the uptime monitor. Supabase sends a warning roughly a week before pausing and a confirmation once paused. The uptime monitor watches Vercel and will happily report the site up with a paused database underneath it. Accepted rather than worked around, on the same reasoning as before: the fix is a dashboard restore, and a scheduled keep awake job was declined.
- Vercel and GitHub Actions build the same commit in parallel, so ordering between a migration and a deploy rests on invariant 1 rather than on machinery. A destructive migration written carelessly breaks production, and nothing will stop it.
- Production runs on Vercel Hobby, which pauses the whole project when free usage is exhausted. That is the intended hard stop, and it means the portfolio URL can go down without warning. The uptime monitor tells you; it does not prevent it.
- Preview trace sampling below 1.0 means a rare failure on a preview may not be sampled. Accepted: previews are hand driven, so a missed sample is noticed by the person driving.
- This feature edits feature 1's code (the sign in guard) and feature 10's future territory (the kill switch read). Both are deliberate and both are named in binding rule 1's allow list already, but it does mean feature 10 inherits a read path it did not write.
- Turning off preview protection later would silently break the guarantee that no real personal data reaches the development project. Nothing enforces the link between those two facts except this spec.

**Neutral**

- The canonical site URL is the production origin even locally, so a metadata check run on `localhost` shows production links. That is correct behaviour and it will look wrong the first time.
- Vercel's framework prefixed system variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_*`) are used rather than the bare ones, because the client bundle needs them. Their exact availability should be confirmed at build time rather than assumed.
- `VERCEL_URL` is documented as incompatible with standard deployment protection. Nothing in this design uses it; the branch URL is used instead.
- The function region was a free choice on this plan, and it is set to `iad1`, beside both databases in `us-east-1`. Settled rather than open.
- The production Supabase project will sit empty until feature 7 ships a way to sign in. That is expected, not a fault, though it is also the reason it will pause.

## Follow-up

- [x] **AC-12 needed a platform fact this spec did not check: branch protection is not offered on a private repository on the free GitHub plan.** Found during the build on 2026-08-21: both the rulesets and the classic branch protection endpoints returned 403, "upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public". **Resolved 2026-08-22**: the full commit history was scanned first and carried no secret (no `.env` file was ever committed, and every `sb_secret_` match was the literal placeholder in documentation), the engineer made the repository public, and protection was applied. `main` now requires a pull request, requires the `Lint, type check, build` check to pass, includes administrators, and refuses force pushes and deletion.
- [ ] **Add `Apply migrations (development)` to the required checks**, once the GitHub Actions secrets are set and the seed's write path has been proved by hand. It is deliberately not required yet: a required check that cannot pass would block every pull request, which is a worse failure than the one it guards. Spec consequences already assume it becomes required, since that is what turns a paused development project into a red pull request.
- [ ] **Feature 4 must carry invariant 1 in its own spec.** The expand then contract rule is written here, but feature 4 owns the real schema and is where a destructive migration will actually be written. A rule that lives only in the deployment spec is a rule the data model spec will not read.
- [x] **Confirm the exact framework prefixed system variable names on Vercel at build time** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`) rather than trusting this spec. **Done, 2026-08-21**, against Vercel's framework environment variables reference: all three exist for the Next.js preset, at both build time and runtime. No fallback variable is needed. Still worth one glance at a real deployed page, since a documented name and a populated one are not the same claim.
- [ ] **Confirm Sentry's current surface for quota notifications** when wiring AC-15. Spec 0001 already carries the same caution about the failure rate alert surface; both are worth doing in one sitting with the `sentry-sdk-setup` skill open. **Surface found, 2026-08-21**: it is called spend notifications, at Settings → Subscription → Manage spend notifications, defaulting to owners and billing members at 80% of reserved volume. Recorded in `docs/observability/README.md`. The box stays open until the setting is actually confirmed on in the Sentry organisation.
- [x] **Check whether `@sentry/nextjs` already infers the release on Vercel** before setting it explicitly, so the release is not configured twice with two different values. **Done, 2026-08-21**: it does, in the installed packages rather than in documentation. `@sentry/node-core` 10.70.0 (`getSentryRelease`) and `@sentry/bundler-plugin-core` 5.3.0 both fall back to `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`, which Vercel populates at build and at runtime. The release is therefore left unset in both Sentry config files, with the check recorded there.
- [ ] **A custom domain is deferred, not declined.** Moving from the `vercel.app` subdomain later means updating three redirect lists (Google, GitHub, Supabase) plus one Vercel setting. Cheapest to do before feature 7 wires OAuth, not after.
- [ ] **Supabase Branching is the better isolation answer and was rejected on cost alone.** Revisit if this project ever has a budget, or if the development project's pausing becomes a real drag.
- [ ] **The Vercel MCP server is present in the environment and unauthorised.** Binding rule 7 says Supabase MCP only, so connecting it is a deliberate decision that would amend that rule, not a default.
- [ ] Agent Skills and MCP discovery for Vercel and GitHub Actions was offered and declined, on the grounds that this environment already exposes Vercel skills. Record the decline in root `AGENTS.md` so it is not offered again.
- [x] Once the production URL is claimed, write the real origin into this spec's configuration table so `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` has one recorded correct value rather than a description of one. **Done, 2026-08-21**: `https://usejobhunt.vercel.app`, in the configuration table and under What is actually provisioned.
- [ ] **Feature 4 inherits the explicit grant rule as well as invariant 1.** With the Data API not exposing new tables, every table feature 4 creates needs its own `grant`, to a role that matches the client meant to read it. Both rules bite only in a hosted project, which is exactly why a spec written against a local Docker database will not think of them.
- [ ] **What task 10's privilege check found**, on the hosted development project on 2026-08-22, in the dashboard query editor:

  - `service_role` holds `select` on `public.app_settings` and `usage` on schema `public`. `anon` and `authenticated` hold nothing on the table. So the design holds as written.
  - The seed's write path (task 5) **succeeded**, twice, with no duplication. So the hosted `postgres` role does bypass row level security for that insert, and the risk task 5 was written to catch did not materialise. The migration's deliberate insert before `force row level security` is therefore belt and braces rather than the load bearing ordering it was written as. Leave it: it costs nothing and the next hosted project is not guaranteed to answer the same way.
  - **The half that decides feature 4, answered.** `service_role` holding `select` on `app_settings` proved nothing about the Data API setting, because that grant is explicit in the migration. The isolating test is `public.scaffold_check`, granted to `authenticated` only and never to `service_role`. `has_table_privilege('service_role', 'public.scaffold_check', 'select')` returns **false** on the hosted development project, and false locally. **The setting withholds privileges from `service_role` too**, contradicting the installed `supabase` skill, which describes it as affecting `anon` and `authenticated` only. The grant in the `app_settings` migration was necessary, invariant 6 is load bearing, and every table feature 4 creates needs its own grant to the role that actually reads it. Written up in full under the data model sketch.
- [ ] **Migrations reached the hosted development project outside the workflow.** Both `20260820041006` and `20260821120000` are recorded in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` there with versions and names, so they were applied by `supabase db push` rather than pasted, and the first workflow run will skip them as already applied. Nothing is broken and no pull request will go red. It is recorded because invariant 5 names the workflow as the only sanctioned path, and a second hand application that happened to be harmless is still worth one line. Production has had neither migration applied and gets both on the first merge to `main`.
- [ ] **The Data API exposure setting stops being a choice on 30 October 2026**, when Supabase applies it to every project. Nothing here needs changing on that date, since both projects are already set that way, and that is the point of doing it now rather than being moved by a platform change later.
- [ ] **An already-pushed migration edited in place leaves every hosted project it already reached silently stale, and `db-migrate.yml` cannot detect it, because invariant 5 names the workflow as the only sanctioned path but says nothing about a file changing after that path has already run once.** Found on feature 10 (spec 0011), 2026-09-04, a third fresh model review: `20260902120000_usage_gating.sql` was pushed to the development project on 2026-09-03, then edited in place twice more, once for that round's own fixes and once for the round after. `supabase db push` compares the migrations directory against the migration history table by version and applies only what is missing (this spec's own rationale.md, line 104), so every push since silently skipped the file, the workflow reported "Remote database is up to date", and the pull request stayed green throughout, the exact "two projects running different schemas" failure this spec's workflow header names, just not caught by anything that runs automatically. Remediated by hand this once with `supabase db reset --linked` (safe only because the development project holds synthetic data by construction, this spec's own Environment topology section), and confirmed afterward by a schema dump against the hosted project rather than by trusting the reset succeeded (`docs/specs/0011-usage-gating-and-kill-switch/verify.md:16`). Two things worth deciding, not yet decided: whether a CI step could catch this class of drift going forward (a content hash of each already-applied migration file, compared against what the history table recorded when it was first pushed, would catch an in-place edit that a version number cannot), and whether the convention should simply be "never edit a migration file once any hosted project has applied it, write a follow-up migration instead", which needs no new tooling but only holds if every session remembers it. Production has never had this specific file's content diverge from what was pushed, since it is not on `main` yet, but the same shape can recur on any future migration edited after its first hosted push.
