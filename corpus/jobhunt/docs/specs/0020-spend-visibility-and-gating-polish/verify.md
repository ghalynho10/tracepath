# Verify: spend visibility and gating polish · spec 0020 · updated 2026-09-11
_Steps derived from spec 0020 acceptance criteria. `/check verify` runs these; `/test` locks the durable ones._

## UI / manual

- [x] Sign in, visit `/search` with no query string → the line `Searches used this week: N of 25.` renders above the search form, before any search has been run → AC-1
- [x] From that page, run a search → the same line still renders, now above the results, and `N` has gone up by exactly one → AC-1, AC-2, AC-11
- [x] Reload `/search` twice without searching → `N` does not move, and no Adzuna call is spent → AC-3
- [x] Sign in as a second, freshly created account and visit `/search` → it shows `0 of 25`, not the first account's number → AC-7
- [x] With the app running, `update public.usage_cap set cap_value = 40 where call_type = 'job_search' and scope = 'account' and period = 'week';` then reload `/search` → the line reads `of 40` with no deploy and no restart. Put the value back afterwards → AC-5
- [x] Break the read (stop the database, or `alter function public.get_job_search_usage_summary() rename to _tmp;`) and reload `/search` → the page shows `We couldn't load your search count just now. You can still search.` with `role="alert"`, the search form still renders underneath, and no number and no zero is shown → AC-6
- [x] Delete one of `job_search`'s three `usage_cap` rows and reload `/search` → the failure notice renders rather than a number, matching the gate's own all or nothing rule. Restore the row → AC-6
- [x] Tab through `/search` with the keyboard → the ordinary usage line is not announced as an alert and is not a focus stop; the failure notice is announced → AC-6
- [x] Read `/privacy` → the `usage_gate_counter.call_type` entry names the AI scoring and checking calls, not job search alone → AC-10
- [x] Read `src/features/legal/stored-fields.ts:76` → the `usage_cap` entry does the same. Confirmed at its source, NOT on `/privacy`: `NON_PERSONAL_TABLES[].why` is read only by `stored-fields.test.ts` and renders nowhere. Split from the step above on 2026-09-12, because the original wording claimed both were on the page and could therefore never pass → AC-10

## Commands

- [x] `pnpm vitest run --project integration-serial test/integration-serial/usage-summary.test.ts` → 9 passed (AC-1 through AC-8) → AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-7, AC-8
- [x] `pnpm vitest run --project integration test/integration/usage-cap-arithmetic.test.ts` → 7 passed; a failure here means an operator changed a cap or `RESULTS_PER_PAGE` moved, and the decision to show `job_search` alone needs a fresh look rather than the assertion being adjusted → AC-9
- [x] `pnpm vitest run --project unit "src/app/(app)/search/page.test.ts"` → 69 passed, including the six under "the weekly usage line (spec 0020)" → AC-1, AC-2, AC-5, AC-6
- [x] `docker exec supabase_db_jobhunt psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "select proacl from pg_proc where proname='get_job_search_usage_summary';"` → `{postgres=X/postgres,authenticated=X/postgres}`, no `anon` → AC-7
- [x] `docker exec supabase_db_jobhunt psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "select grantee, privilege_type from information_schema.role_table_grants where table_name='usage_gate_counter' and grantee in ('anon','authenticated','service_role');"` → no rows → AC-8
- [x] `grep -c "insert\|update\|delete" supabase/migrations/20260911120000_job_search_usage_summary.sql` counted against the file: the function body contains no write statement of any kind → AC-3

## Value sourcing

One step per row of spec 0020's Value sourcing table, each exercising the source rather than the rendered result.

- [x] Seed a counter row with `attempt_count` and `consumed_count` deliberately far apart (for example 19 and 4), reload `/search` → the line shows 4. `attempt_count` counts refused attempts that spent no budget, so showing it would overstate the spend → AC-2
- [x] Compare the `period_start` the page reports against the one `check_usage_gate` actually wrote to `usage_gate_counter` for the same caller → identical. This is the row that breaks at a week boundary if the two expressions ever drift → AC-4
- [x] `select pg_get_functiondef(oid) from pg_proc where proname in ('check_usage_gate','get_job_search_usage_summary');` → both bodies contain the same `pg_catalog.date_trunc('week', pg_catalog.now() at time zone 'utc')::date` text, character for character → AC-4
- [x] Call the RPC as one account while a second account holds a different count → each gets its own, proving the account comes from `auth.uid()` inside the function and not from anything the caller supplies → AC-7
- [x] Call `getJobSearchUsageSummary()` with an empty cookie jar → `session_missing`, refused by the `getClaims()` check before the RPC → AC-7
- [x] Confirm the notice is rendered above the `hasQuery` conditional in `src/app/(app)/search/page.tsx`, not inside either branch → a placement below it would show the line for the first time only after the search that spent one → AC-1

## Acceptance-criteria coverage

- AC-1 covered by the bare visit, the with results visit, and the placement check
- AC-2 covered by the seeded divergence step and its integration counterpart
- AC-3 covered by the reload step, the no row created integration test, and the no write statement check
- AC-4 covered by the written `period_start` comparison and the byte identical expression check
- AC-5 covered by the live cap change step
- AC-6 covered by the broken read step, the unconfigured cap step, and the keyboard step
- AC-7 covered by the second account step, the grant check, and the no session step
- AC-8 covered by the `usage_gate_counter` grant check and the direct select refusal test
- AC-9 covered by `test/integration/usage-cap-arithmetic.test.ts`
- AC-10 covered by reading `/privacy`

## Run record, 2026-09-11

Verified against the running dev server on `http://localhost:3000` with two real
minted sessions, six real Adzuna searches, and the live local database. Two
steps above are left unticked.

**The failing one.** "run a search, and `N` has gone up by exactly one" does not
hold. On a render that runs a search, the usage line reports the count from
BEFORE that search was counted, every time (four consecutive trials, then a
fifth at the cap boundary). A plain reload afterwards shows the true number, so
the line is only ever wrong on the render a person is most likely to read it.
Observed at the boundary: an account seeded to 24 of 25 ran its last allowed
search, the page rendered results reading `Searches used this week: 24 of 25`
while the database held 25, and the next search was refused. The last thing the
page told that person before refusing them was that they had one search left,
which is the surprise this spec's Summary exists to remove.

The code does what the spec says: AC-1 asks for the count to be read live on
every render and it is. The spec never decided what the number should mean on a
render whose own search is still in flight, so this is an owed decision rather
than a defect to patch.

**The other one.** `/privacy` renders the `usage_gate_counter.call_type`
sentence, corrected and confirmed on the page. It does NOT render the
`usage_cap` one: `NON_PERSONAL_TABLES[].why` is read only by
`src/features/legal/stored-fields.test.ts` and reaches no user facing surface.
The correction AC-10 asks for IS in `stored-fields.ts` at line 76, so the
criterion is met at its source; the step is left unticked because it cannot be
confirmed the way it is written.

## Revision steps, added 2026-09-12 (AC-11 to AC-15)

- [x] Sign in, run a search → the figure counts that search. Three consecutive searches showed 1, 2, 3 against a database holding 1, 2, 3 → AC-11
- [x] Seed an account to one below its cap, run its last allowed search → the page reads `25 of 25` beside the results, the database holds 25, and no refusal shows on that render. The next search is refused. This is the exact case that failed on 2026-09-11 → AC-11, AC-13
- [x] Bare visit and search render both show the line, from the same read → AC-12
- [x] Turn the kill switch on, run a search → the figure is unchanged, the kill switch sentence shows, and nothing is consumed. This is the path that never reaches `check_usage_gate`, so it is the one a design carrying the number back from the gate decision would have got wrong → AC-13
- [x] A search that passes the gate then fails at Adzuna → the figure includes the spend. Covered by `test/integration-serial/usage-line-ordering.test.ts` against the real gate and the real counters with the Adzuna response forced to 503. NOT driven through HTTP: forcing an Adzuna failure in the running dev server would mean restarting it with a bad key → AC-14
- [x] `anon` cannot execute `check_usage_gate` or `get_job_search_usage_summary`, and `authenticated` still can → AC-15
- [x] Break the usage read on a SEARCH render (rename the function away) → the notice shows with `role="alert"`, no number is rendered, and the results still render underneath → AC-6

## Run record, 2026-09-12

PASS. All fifteen criteria met, driven against the running dev server on `http://localhost:3000` with two real minted sessions, six real Adzuna searches, and the live local database.

The two steps left unticked on 2026-09-11 are now closed. The search render figure is correct on every trial, including at the cap boundary where it previously said `24 of 25` while the database held 25. The `/privacy` step was split in two rather than ticked as written, because the original wording asserted both corrected sentences were on the rendered page and only one is; the other is confirmed at its source, which is what spec 0020's corrected AC-10 now says.

State restored after the run: both fixture users deleted, `job_search` global counters cleared, all nine `usage_cap` rows at their seeded values, the kill switch back to false, and both `security definer` functions present with their original grants.

## Correction slice run, 2026-09-13 (spec 0020 steps 12 to 15)

PASS. The correction was behaviour preserving by design, so this run proved two separate things.

**Behaviour identical, before and after.** The same three probes were driven against the current code and then against the pre correction commit (`ab5c594^`), on the same dev server, with two separately minted accounts seeded identically. Every output matched:

| Probe | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Bare visit | `0 of 25`, no counter row created | `0 of 25`, no counter row created |
| Last allowed search, seeded at 24 | `25 of 25`, db 25, results rendered, no refusal | identical |
| The search after that | `25 of 25`, refused | identical |

**The criteria still hold.** Kill switch refusal leaves the figure unchanged at `7 of 25` with nothing consumed (AC-13, the path that never reaches `check_usage_gate`); two accounts see their own numbers (AC-7); a live cap edit shows `7 of 40` with no deploy (AC-5); breaking the read on a SEARCH render, the newly reshaped path, shows the notice with `role="alert"`, no number, and the results still rendering underneath (AC-6); the read function contains no write statement (AC-3); `anon` cannot execute either `security definer` function while `authenticated` can (AC-8, AC-15). Suites: 74, 9, 6, 7 and 4 passed.

**AC-11's two guards, re measured in this session rather than trusted from the build:**

- Deleting the `await` inside `UsageNotice`: three ordering tests fail AND ESLint reports the prop unused.
- Folding the two waits into `Promise.all`: three ordering tests fail and **ESLint stays clean**.

That second line is the honest limit of the design and matches what the spec now records: lint guards deletion, the tests guard reordering, and nothing but the tests catches the fold.

State restored: four fixture users deleted, `job_search` counters cleared, all nine `usage_cap` rows at their seeded values, kill switch `false`, both functions present with their grants.
