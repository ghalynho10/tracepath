# Verify: job search and results list · spec 0013 · updated 2026-09-04

_Steps derived from spec 0013's acceptance criteria and every row of its Value sourcing table. `/check verify` runs these; `/test` locks the durable ones._

**All 48 steps were run and passed on 2026-09-04**, on a separate run from the build, against the real local Supabase stack and the real Adzuna API, with freshly minted sessions. Some step text below still says "Observed during the build"; that wording records where the observation was first made, and every one of them was re-run here rather than inherited.

Forty five ran under `/check verify`. The last three came from `/architect` later the same day, after a cross check found that the back navigation step had been measured under `pnpm dev` and had produced a wrong conclusion. **That step now says in terms to run it against a production build**, and two new steps guard the reason it matters: the production `Cache-Control` header, and the absence of any query carrying `<Link>`.

Two notes on how the harder steps were exercised, so a later reader knows what the tick means:

- The forced Adzuna failures (timeout, non success status, unparseable body, one bad item, every item bad) cannot be driven from a browser, because the `fetch` runs server side. They were proved by calling the real `searchListings()` against the real stack and the real gate with only Adzuna's own response controlled, so the gate, the parse and the failure kinds are all real. The visible failure state itself was proved separately in the browser with a deliberately wrong `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`, which produces a genuine 401 from Adzuna.
- The two attribution links were confirmed by reading their `href` and accessible name out of the live DOM rather than by navigating away to Adzuna. The posting link WAS clicked for real: it opened Adzuna's own page in a new tab while `/search` stayed put.

**Setup.** These need a signed in session and the local stack (`pnpm db:start`, `pnpm dev`). A session can be minted without a browser handshake the way the integration suite does it (`test/helpers/session.ts`), then its cookie set on `localhost`. Real `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` must be in `.env.local` for any step that reaches Adzuna.

## UI / manual

- [x] Sign in, visit `/search` with a `job_preference` row holding `desired_titles[0] = "software engineer"` and `desired_locations[0] = "Boston"` → both fields prefill with those exact values, no results render, and no `usage_gate_counter` row is created or incremented for `job_search` (check the table before and after) → AC-9
- [x] Visit `/search` as a caller with **no** `job_preference` row → both fields render blank, not a placeholder or a dash, and still no gate spend → AC-9
- [x] Visit `/search` as a caller whose `desired_titles` is an empty array → the title field is blank rather than erroring → AC-9
- [x] **Added at spec revision 3. Run 2026-09-04 and passed.** Break the prefill read for real (revoke `select` on `job_preference` from `authenticated` inside a transaction, or point the client at a dead port) and visit bare `/search` → the page shows `COPY-6` above the form, the fields are still typeable, and typing a title and submitting still runs a real search → AC-9. **Assert the reader's experience, not the branch**: the two screens this step exists to separate are "your saved preferences could not be loaded" and "you have not saved any", so run it back to back with the no `job_preference` row step above and confirm they look different. A step that only checked the failure branch was reached would pass on the build this amendment corrects. **How it was run**: `revoke select on public.job_preference from authenticated` against the local stack, then the real `/search` page fetched over HTTP from a real `next dev` server with a real minted session, using the existing `startAppServer()` and `mintSession()` helpers. Three screens compared in one pass: the prefilled one carried the stated title and location, the no preferences one carried neither those nor any alert, and the broken one carried `COPY-6` inside a `role="alert"` with both inputs still present, and was not byte identical to the no preferences screen. A real search with `?q=engineer` ran and returned listings while the read was still broken, confirming the failure costs the prefill and nothing else. The grant was restored afterwards and confirmed restored by reading the grants back, not by assuming the restore ran
- [x] Submit the form with a real title and location → the URL becomes `/search?q=...&where=...`, real Adzuna listings render, at most 20 of them, and the page ships no client JavaScript for search (view source: the results are in the server rendered HTML) → AC-1
- [x] Submit with **both** fields empty → `COPY-3` renders in a `role="alert"`, no Adzuna call is made (no new `usage_gate_counter` increment), and no results or attribution appear → AC-2
- [x] Search a title that matches nothing (e.g. `zzzznosuchjobtitlezzzz`) → `COPY-4` renders, and it carries **no** `role="alert"`, since an empty result is an ordinary outcome and not a failure → AC-4
- [x] Confirm the empty state is visually and structurally distinct from both the refusal and failure states (no alert role, different sentence) → AC-4
- [x] Engage the kill switch (`update public.app_settings set kill_switch_enabled = true where id = 1`), then search → the exact `kill_switch_engaged` sentence from `src/lib/usage-gating/copy.ts` renders verbatim, no Adzuna call runs, and zero attribution blocks appear. **Restore the switch afterwards.** Observed during the build → AC-3
- [x] Exhaust an account's weekly `job_search` cap, then search → the exact `account_week_cap_reached` sentence renders, verbatim from the same map, and no Adzuna call runs → AC-3
- [x] Restart the app with a deliberately wrong `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` and search → `COPY-5` renders inside a `role="alert"`, distinct from the empty state. Observed during the build → AC-5
- [x] Force a timeout (throttle or block `api.adzuna.com`) and search → the same failure state renders, and Sentry shows `external_service_failed`, not `response_malformed` → AC-5
- [x] Serve Adzuna a body that is valid JSON but not the expected shape → the failure state renders and Sentry shows `response_malformed` → AC-5
- [x] Serve a batch where one listing of several fails its own item parse → the remaining listings render normally and only the bad one disappears; the page does **not** fail → AC-1, AC-5
- [x] Serve a batch where **every** listing fails its item parse → the failure state renders with `response_malformed` → AC-5
- [x] On a page of results, count the "Jobs by Adzuna" attribution blocks → exactly one per rendered listing, never one per screen. Observed during the build: 20 blocks for 20 cards → AC-6
- [x] Measure each attribution block's rendered box (`getBoundingClientRect`) → every one is at least 116 by 23 CSS pixels. Observed during the build: smallest 125.6 by 23 → AC-6
- [x] Repeat that measurement at a 320 pixel viewport → the floor still holds and the page has no horizontal overflow (`scrollWidth === innerWidth`). Observed during the build → AC-6
- [x] Click the word "Jobs", then click the Adzuna logo → both open `https://www.adzuna.com`, and the logo carries a real accessible name ("Adzuna") rather than being `aria-hidden` → AC-6
- [x] Find a listing with a predicted salary → the figure is followed by "(estimated)", and a Jobsworth block sits beside it: an icon measuring exactly 20 by 20, the words "Adzuna Jobsworth", both linked to `http://www.adzuna.co.uk/jobs/salary-predictor.html`, with the mouseover text "Salary estimate powered by Adzuna Jobsworth". Observed during the build → AC-7
- [x] Find a listing with a **stated** salary → it shows neither "(estimated)" nor any Jobsworth block. Observed during the build (one of twenty) → AC-7
- [x] Find a listing with no salary at all → no salary line, no "(estimated)", no Jobsworth block, and no dash or placeholder standing in for the figure → AC-7, invariant 7
- [x] On one result, confirm all of: title, company, location, a relative posted date, a salary range when present, and a description snippet → AC-8
- [x] Click "View the posting" → it opens the real source posting in a **new tab**, carries `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and its accessible name names that specific job rather than being the generic visible label → AC-8
- [x] Confirm a listing missing an optional field (no location, or no snippet) simply omits that row rather than rendering an empty one → invariant 7
- [x] Note the `usage_gate_counter` value, then reload the results URL and open the same URL in a fresh tab → each spends exactly one gate check and one Adzuna call, never zero and never two → AC-10
  - **Result, 2026-09-04.** Three requests reached the server (submit, reload, fresh tab) and the account counter went 0 to 3. Five that carry no usable query (three prefill visits, a blank query, a signed out attempt) spent nothing.
- [x] **Run this one against a production build** (`pnpm build && pnpm start`), not `pnpm dev`. Press browser back onto the results URL → it reaches the server and spends exactly one, the same as any other request → AC-10
  - **THE STEP MOST LIKELY TO BE MEASURED WRONG, and it already was once.** Under `pnpm dev` a back navigation costs nothing, because `next dev` deliberately sends `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` so the browser answers back and forward from its own HTTP cache. A production build sends `no-store` and the request really is made. Measured both ways on 2026-09-04: under `pnpm dev` one load plus one back moved the counter by one, under `pnpm start` the same two steps moved it by two. A dev only run here produces a confident, wrong conclusion, and on that day it produced a wrong "correction" to this spec before a cross check caught it.
- [x] Confirm the production `Cache-Control` on `/search` directly: `pnpm build && pnpm start`, then `curl -sI 'http://localhost:3000/search?q=a' | grep -i cache-control` → it contains `no-store`. If it ever stops containing `no-store`, the back navigation half of AC-10 and the Consequences paragraph both need re measuring, because that header is the whole reason the request is made → AC-10
- [x] No `<Link>` anywhere carries `q` or `where`: `grep -rn 'href=.*/search?' src/` returns no query carrying link → AC-10. A prefetched link would spend a person's weekly budget on hover, with no intent behind it. Today the only internal link to `/search` is the header's, which is bare (and free by AC-9), so this is a guard against a future saved search chip or a "search again" link, feature 18 above all
- [x] Visit `/search?q=a&q=b` → only the first value is used; the two are not joined into one term → security model
- [x] Visit `/search?q=...` while signed **out** → the `(app)` layout guard sends the visitor to sign in, and no Adzuna call runs → security model
- [x] Keyboard only: tab through the form and one result card → both fields reach focus with a visible ring and a real label, the submit button is reachable, and both attribution links and the posting link are reachable in order → WCAG 2.2 AA
- [x] Load `/` signed out → the "What's real today" card lists `filtered search` under **working** and not under `planned` → AC-12
- [x] Load `/privacy` → Adzuna appears in the recipients list with what it receives and why → AC-11

## Commands

- [x] `pnpm test` → all unit tests pass, including `src/features/search/adzuna-logo.test.ts` → AC-6
- [x] `pnpm test:integration` → all integration tests pass against the real stack
- [x] `pnpm lint && pnpm format:check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build` → all four clean
- [x] Break `ADZUNA_WORDMARK_PATH` by one character in `adzuna-logo-geometry.ts`, run `pnpm test` → `adzuna-logo.test.ts` fails. Restore it. Proved on 2026-09-04 → AC-6
- [x] Remove the `adzuna` entry from `DATA_RECIPIENTS`, run `pnpm test` → `recipients.test.ts` fails on the unclassified `ADZUNA_APP_ID`/`ADZUNA_APP_KEY` keys. Restore it → AC-11
- [x] Grep `src/app/api/` for any search route → there is none; search never runs through a route handler → Decision
- [x] Confirm `search.run` and `search.read_prefill` are both registered in `docs/observability/spans.md` and that each opens as the first statement of its function → binding rule 4

## Value sourcing

One step per row of the spec's Value sourcing table, exercising the edge that breaks if the source is wrong.

- [x] Salary currency: confirm a salary renders as `USD` and that the value comes from `ADZUNA_COUNTRY`, not from Adzuna. Adzuna's response carries **no** currency field at all, so grep the response body for a currency key → there is none. Changing `ADZUNA_COUNTRY` must change the rendered currency → invariant 3
- [x] Attribution domain: confirm both "Jobs" and the logo point at the domain derived from `ADZUNA_COUNTRY` (`https://www.adzuna.com` for `us`), not a hardcoded string in the component → AC-6
- [x] Jobsworth link: confirm it is the fixed `adzuna.co.uk` URL and does **not** vary with `ADZUNA_COUNTRY`, since Adzuna's terms state that one without a local domain alternative → AC-7, Follow-up
- [x] Relative posted date: render a listing whose `created` is under an hour old, one a few days old, and one absent → "posted N hours ago", "posted N days ago", and no date row at all, computed at render and never stored formatted → AC-8
- [x] Relative posted date across a timezone: run the page with `TZ` set to something far from local (e.g. `Pacific/Kiritimati`) → the relative date stays correct, since it is computed from an elapsed difference rather than from a local calendar day → AC-8
- [x] Prefill source: change `desired_titles[0]` in the database, reload bare `/search` → the field reflects the new value, proving it reads the row rather than a cached or hardcoded value → AC-9
- [x] Predicted flag: confirm a listing whose raw `salary_is_predicted` is the **string** `"1"` renders as predicted. Adzuna's own docs example shows a numeric `0`, but the live API returned `"1"` as a string on 2026-09-04, and the schema accepts both. A schema narrowed to the documented numeric form alone would drop every predicted listing → AC-7
- [x] Inverted salary: serve a listing whose `salary_max` is below its `salary_min` → both figures are dropped rather than rendered inverted, since spec 0003's check constraint would refuse the pair at feature 12's insert → data model
