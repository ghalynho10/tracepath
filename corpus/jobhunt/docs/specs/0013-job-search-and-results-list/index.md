# 0013. Job search and results list

**Date**: 2026-09-04
**Status**: Accepted
**Revision 3**, 2026-09-04: AC-9 amended and `COPY-6` added. A failed `job_preference` read rendered the same screen as a caller who has stated no preferences, so a database fault silently borrowed the meaning of "you have not set any". That is the "default that reads like success" `AGENTS.md` forbids, and AC-9 was the criterion that let it through: it named the blank field state without saying what makes it true. No decision changed, and nothing about the prefill's shape or its no spend guarantee moved. Raised by `/check review` on 2026-09-04.

**Revision 2**, 2026-09-04: AC-10 sharpened, and its back navigation claim **restored** after a wrong correction. It now turns on a document request rather than a vague "render", names the three request kinds that cost nothing, and forbids a prefetch carrying `q` or `where`. Verified against a production build, since `next dev` gives a false answer here. No decision changed. The first Follow-up item tells the story, which is worth reading before trusting any browser behaviour claim in this repo.

## Summary

This spec builds the first real search screen: a signed in user types a title and or a location, the app spends one budget checked call against Adzuna (the job board this project already committed to), and real listings come back with the attribution Adzuna's own terms require. Nothing here persists. Clicking through to a real posting, and marking a job applied, stay feature 12's job; this feature only searches and displays. The two hardest parts are not the search itself: they are meeting Adzuna's exact attribution wording without guessing, and making sure a caller can never spend an outbound call without passing feature 10's budget gate first.

## Requirements

**User stories**:
- As a signed in user, I want to search real job listings by title and location, so I can see what is actually available rather than a mock.
- As a signed in user, I want my own weekly preferences to prefill the search so I do not retype them every visit.
- As a signed in user, I want a clear, honest reason when a search is blocked or fails, so I know whether it is my own usage, a shared limit, or something broken.
- As the operator, I want Adzuna's attribution requirements met exactly as written, so the app stays inside the terms that let it use their data at all.

**Acceptance criteria** (the contract, each independently checkable):

- **AC-1**: A signed in user who submits a search with at least one of title or location filled sees real Adzuna listings for the configured country (United States) rendered on the page, first page only, up to 20 results, no pagination this slice.
- **AC-2**: A search submitted with both title and location blank is refused before any external call runs, with a visible validation message, and spends no usage gate budget.
- **AC-3**: Every search that passes AC-2's check is checked through `checkUsageGate("job_search")` before the Adzuna call runs. A refusal, for any of the five reasons feature 10 defines, renders the exact sentence from `src/lib/usage-gating/copy.ts`'s `SENTENCES` map for that reason, and the Adzuna call never runs.
- **AC-4**: A search that runs successfully and matches zero listings renders a visible "no results" state, clearly distinct from both the gate refusal state (AC-3) and the failure state (AC-5).
- **AC-5**: An Adzuna call that fails outright (network error, timeout, a non success response) is reported through `failure()` with `external_service_failed`; a response that does not match the expected shape is reported with `response_malformed`. Either renders a visible failure state distinct from AC-4's empty state.
- **AC-6**: Every rendered result carries its own "Jobs by Adzuna" attribution, at least 116 by 23 pixels, through `Card.Footer`'s `attribution` slot (spec 0005, AC-10): the word "Jobs" links to `https://www.adzuna.com`, and the word "Adzuna" is the Adzuna logo image, also linked to `https://www.adzuna.com`.
- **AC-7**: A result whose salary is predicted (Adzuna's `salary_is_predicted: true`) shows "(estimated)" beside the figure and carries the separate Jobsworth attribution: a 20 by 20 pixel icon plus the words "Adzuna Jobsworth", both linked to `http://www.adzuna.co.uk/jobs/salary-predictor.html`, with the mouseover text "Salary estimate powered by Adzuna Jobsworth". A stated, non predicted salary shows neither the label nor the Jobsworth attribution.
- **AC-8**: Each result shows its title, company, location, a relative posted date (e.g. "posted 3 days ago", computed at render from the raw timestamp), a salary range when present, and its description snippet, plus a real, working link that opens the source posting (`job_url`) in a new tab.
- **AC-9**: On a first visit to `/search` carrying neither `q` nor `where`, the title and location fields prefill from the caller's `job_preference` row (the first entry of `desired_titles` and of `desired_locations`) when present; a caller with no `job_preference` row, or an empty array, sees blank fields. **Blank fields mean "you have stated no preferences" and may mean nothing else**: when the read itself fails, the page says so in `COPY-6` rather than presenting the same screen, because a failure that renders as an ordinary outcome is the silent failure `AGENTS.md` forbids, and the reader who did state preferences would otherwise have no way to tell a database fault from their own empty profile. The failure does not block the form: the fields are still typeable and a search still runs, since the prefill is a convenience and nothing downstream depends on it. Landing on the page this way never itself runs a search or spends gate budget, on any of these three paths; a search only runs once the URL carries `q` or `where`.
- **AC-10**: The `job_search` call type spends exactly one gate check and, when allowed, exactly one outbound Adzuna call per **document request** to `/search` that carries a non empty `q` or `where` from a signed in caller: never zero, never two. A fresh submit, a reload, a shared link, and **a browser back or forward navigation** each cause such a request on a deployed build, so each costs one. Three kinds of request cost nothing, and they are consequences of this rule rather than exceptions to it, because none of them reaches the Adzuna call: one carrying neither parameter (AC-9), one whose parameters are both blank (AC-2), and one from a caller who is not signed in (the `(app)` layout redirects first). **No automatic or speculative request may carry `q` or `where`**, a `<Link>` prefetch above all: that would spend a person's weekly budget on hover, with no intent behind it. Verify this against a production build (`pnpm build && pnpm start`), never `next dev`, for the reason Consequences gives.
- **AC-11**: `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` are added to `DATA_RECIPIENTS` in `src/features/legal/recipients.ts`, naming Adzuna as the recipient, as part of this build, satisfying spec 0009 AC-5's drift guard.
- **AC-12**: This feature moves its own claim (`filtered search`) from planned to working in the entry page's "What's real today" card (spec 0006, AC-8).

## Options considered

Reasoning and the options weighed for how the search itself is triggered: see [rationale.md](rationale.md).

## Decision

**Chosen option**: A signed in `Server Component` reading the search terms from the URL (`/search?q=...&where=...`), never a Server Action or a client side fetch.

The whole operation, gate check, Adzuna call, and Zod parse, runs server side inside one function, `searchListings()`, called from `src/app/(app)/search/page.tsx`. No client JavaScript ships for search itself. A plain `<form method="get" action="/search">` with inputs named `q` and `where` is what actually produces the URL this relies on; there is no client side submit handler.

> **This claim was narrowed on 2026-09-05, when feature 12 shipped. Read it before relying on either half.**
>
> **Still true:** the search itself is a Server Component reading the URL. No Server Action and no client side fetch produces results, the form is still a plain `GET`, and a shared `/search?q=...` link is still a real working search.
>
> **No longer true:** that `/search` ships no client JavaScript. Spec [0014](../0014-apply-redirect-and-application-record/index.md) adds `ApplyControl`, one Client Component per result card, and it could not be avoided. Feature 12's apply must not re-render this page, because a re-render re-runs `searchListings()` and spends one of the 25 weekly Adzuna calls; a form with no JavaScript needs a rendered response, which IS that re-render. So the choice was client JavaScript or a per apply cost, and the cost lost.
>
> The boundary is drawn as small as it goes: the page, the form, the twenty cards, both attributions and every salary line remain server rendered. Recorded here rather than only in spec 0014's Consequences, because this is the sentence a later reader would otherwise take at face value.

`searchListings()` never returns `Result<Listing[]>` directly. A refusal (spec 0011, AC-5) is a success carrying `allowed: false`, never a `Failure`, so the return type has to carry both branches: `Result<{ allowed: true; value: Listing[] } | { allowed: false; reason: UsageGateReason }>`. This is exactly what the new `withUsageGate()` helper (Build plan step 2) returns generically, and `searchListings()` is its first real caller.

## Rationale

Full reasoning and the options weighed: see [rationale.md](rationale.md).

## Feature design

**Data model sketch**:

No new database table. Results are never persisted (by product decision, recorded in `docs/scope/scope.md`'s Slice 1 introduction), so the only new shape is an in memory value object, Zod parsed at the Adzuna response boundary and never written to Postgres. Feature 12 imports this exact shape later for its own field mapping (spec 0003 already names feature 11 as owner of that mapping).

`Listing` (in memory, request scoped):

| Field | Type | Required | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `source` | literal `"adzuna"` | yes | a constant, exported once as `ADZUNA_SOURCE` so feature 12 imports the same literal rather than re declaring it (spec 0003's Value sourcing table names this feature as the one that sets it). **It moved to `src/lib/adzuna.ts` on 2026-09-05** (spec 0014): this feature now imports it too, so neither feature imports from the other |
| `sourceJobId` | string, non empty | yes | Adzuna `id`, coerced to string (Adzuna's own docs do not commit to a JSON type for it). Trimmed and required non empty since 2026-09-05 (spec 0014, AC-13) |
| `title` | string, non empty | yes | Adzuna `title`. Trimmed and required non empty since 2026-09-05 (spec 0014, AC-13) |
| `companyName` | string, non empty | yes | Adzuna `company.display_name`. Trimmed and required non empty since 2026-09-05 (spec 0014, AC-13) |
| `location` | string | no | Adzuna `location.display_name` |
| `url` | string (URL) | yes | Adzuna `redirect_url` |
| `descriptionSnippet` | string | no | Adzuna `description` (a snippet only; Adzuna does not return the full posting text; see Follow-up on spec 0003's column note) |
| `salaryMin` | number | no | Adzuna `salary_min` |
| `salaryMax` | number | no | Adzuna `salary_max`. If Adzuna ever returns a max below the min, the Zod schema drops both rather than passing an inverted pair forward, since spec 0003's own check constraint would refuse it outright at feature 12's insert |
| `salaryCurrency` | string | no, present exactly when either salary figure is | a constant derived from the configured country (`ADZUNA_COUNTRY = "us"` maps to `"USD"`), never from Adzuna, whose response carries no currency field at all |
| `salaryIsPredicted` | boolean | yes | Adzuna `salary_is_predicted` |
| `postedAt` | string | no | Adzuna `created`, accepted as ANY string here rather than a validated datetime, which this row originally overstated. Feature 12 refuses a non datetime at its own boundary instead (spec 0014, AC-2), because an unparseable value only becomes a problem when it reaches `posted_at timestamptz` |

Adzuna's response is parsed as an envelope first (does the whole body match the expected shape at all) and then per item: a single listing that fails its own parse is dropped and counted, not treated as a reason to fail the whole page. `response_malformed` is only reported when every item in a non empty batch fails, since one bad row among twenty is Adzuna's data quality, not a broken integration (feature 19 owns data quality properly; this is just refusing to let one bad row blank an otherwise good page).

`SearchQuery` (parsed from URL search params, request scoped):

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | no, but at least one of `title`/`location` required | trimmed, max 200 characters, maps to Adzuna's `what` |
| `location` | string | no, but at least one of `title`/`location` required | trimmed, max 200 characters, maps to Adzuna's `where` |

**The Adzuna request itself**, named explicitly rather than left to the build to invent:

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint | `https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/{ADZUNA_COUNTRY}/search/1` | page fixed to `1` (AC-1, first page only) |
| `results_per_page` | `20` | matches AC-1's "up to 20 results" |
| `sort_by` | omitted | Adzuna's own default (relevance) is used deliberately; no sort control exists this slice (structured filters are Slice 3), and ranking intelligence arrives properly in Slice 2 rather than being approximated here by switching to a date sort |
| timeout | `8000` ms, via `AbortSignal.timeout(8000)` | so a hung Adzuna request fails visibly (AC-5) rather than holding the render open indefinitely |

A response whose HTTP status is not success (`res.ok` false, most likely a `429` given Adzuna's 25 calls a minute ceiling) is treated the same as a thrown error: reported as `external_service_failed`, never parsed as if it were a listings body. `fetch()` itself does not throw on a non success status, so this check is explicit rather than assumed to fall out of `attempt()`.

**Copy**: one slot per user facing string, text left for the engineer to write before `/develop`, the same convention specs 0007 and 0011 use.

| Slot | Shown when | Text |
|---|---|---|
| `COPY-1` | the title field's label | _to be written_ |
| `COPY-2` | the location field's label | _to be written_ |
| `COPY-3` | both fields submitted blank (AC-2) | _to be written; should say at least one field is needed, not just "invalid"_ |
| `COPY-4` | a search matches zero listings (AC-4) | _to be written; should read as a normal outcome, not a failure, matching the "no `role=\"alert\"`" convention the current placeholder page already sets_ |
| `COPY-5` | the Adzuna call fails or its response cannot be parsed (AC-5) | _to be written; a generic, honest failure message, not a technical one_ |
| `COPY-6` | the `job_preference` read behind the prefill fails (AC-9) | "We couldn't load your saved preferences, so the fields below start empty. You can still search." Added at revision 3 and written rather than left as a slot, since the sentence is the whole point of the amendment. It carries `role="alert"`, matching `COPY-3` and `COPY-5` and deliberately unlike `COPY-4`: this is a real failure, not the ordinary empty outcome. |

The five gate refusal reasons already have their sentences in `src/lib/usage-gating/copy.ts` (spec 0011); this feature renders those verbatim and writes no copy of its own for them.

**State transitions**: none. Neither shape is persisted, so there is no lifecycle to define.

**API surface**:

| Surface | Kind | Key inputs | Key outputs | Auth | Key errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /search` | page (Server Component) | URL search params `q?`, `where?` | rendered listings, or the empty, failure, or refusal state | signed in, via the existing `(app)` layout guard (spec 0008) | none thrown; every failure renders inline |
| the search form, `src/features/search/search-form.tsx` | plain HTML form | title/location text inputs, prefilled per AC-9 | a browser navigation to `/search?q=...&where=...` | none (it only ever produces a `GET` to the page above) | none; client side has nothing to fail, `AC-2`'s check happens server side on submit |
| `searchListings()` in `src/features/search/adzuna.ts` | server function | `{ title?: string; location?: string }`, plus an optional `cookieAdapter?: CookieMethodsServer` (the same test seam `checkUsageGate()` already exposes, spec 0011) | a `Result` whose success value is either `{ allowed: true, value: Listing[] }` or `{ allowed: false, reason: UsageGateReason }` (see Decision) | called only from the signed in route above; internally verified again by `checkUsageGate()`'s own `getClaims()` check | `validation_failed` (both fields blank), `session_missing`, `usage_gate_misconfigured`, `database_unavailable` (all three real `checkUsageGate()` failure kinds, spec 0011), `external_service_failed`, `response_malformed` |

**Value sourcing**:

| Action | Value produced or displayed | Source |
|---|---|---|
| render results | the title/location query values | URL search params `q`/`where`, or the prefill below when both are absent |
| render results | the prefilled title/location | `job_preference.desired_titles[0]` / `job_preference.desired_locations[0]` for the caller (spec 0003's existing table, read only) |
| render results | the Adzuna country | the constant `ADZUNA_COUNTRY = "us"`, a code constant, not an environment variable, since it does not vary by deploy environment |
| render results | Adzuna credentials | `env.ADZUNA_APP_ID`, `env.ADZUNA_APP_KEY`, server only |
| render results | each listing's fields | parsed one to one from Adzuna's response, per the `Listing` table above |
| render results | `salaryCurrency` | derived from `ADZUNA_COUNTRY` via a small constant map (`{ us: "USD" }`), never from Adzuna |
| render results | the "Jobs"/"Adzuna" attribution link target | derived from `ADZUNA_COUNTRY` via a constant map (`{ us: "https://www.adzuna.com" }`), per Adzuna's terms allowing "the relevant local domain" |
| render results | the Jobsworth attribution link target | the fixed URL quoted verbatim in Adzuna's terms, `http://www.adzuna.co.uk/jobs/salary-predictor.html` (the terms state this one without a local domain alternative, unlike the main attribution clause; see Follow-up) |
| render results | the Adzuna logo image asset | supplied by the engineer before this feature is built; not sourced by this spec (see Follow-up) |
| refusal state | the sentence shown | `src/lib/usage-gating/copy.ts`'s `SENTENCES` map, keyed by the reason `checkUsageGate()` returns |
| any state | the relative posted date text | computed at render from `postedAt` with `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat("en-US")`, never stored formatted; omitted entirely when `postedAt` is absent, never shown as a placeholder |

**Key invariants**:

1. Exactly one Adzuna call, and exactly one usage gate check, per user submitted search, never zero and never more than one, so spec 0011's own accounting assumption ("the cap counts outbound API calls") holds exactly.
2. A usage gate refusal, or a blank query, always short circuits before any Adzuna call, enforced structurally by the `withUsageGate()` helper (see Build plan), never left to a caller remembering to check `allowed` first.
3. Currency is never read from Adzuna; it is always the constant derived from the configured country.
4. Attribution renders once per displayed listing, never once per screen. A screen with zero listings shows no attribution block, since there is nothing to attribute.
5. A predicted salary is never shown indistinguishably from a stated one.
6. No listing data is ever written to the database by this feature. Every result is request scoped and re fetched on the next search.
7. An optional field with no value (`location`, `descriptionSnippet`, either salary figure, `postedAt`) is simply omitted from the card, never rendered as a placeholder or a dash that could be mistaken for real data.

**Security model**:

Only a signed in caller reaches `/search`'s real content, enforced by the existing `(app)` layout guard (spec 0008); this feature adds no new authorization rule, since a search targets nobody's data but the caller's own preferences and a public search API. `checkUsageGate()` already verifies the caller with `getClaims()` before spending any budget (spec 0011); this feature adds no separate identity check. The only things sent outward are the caller's typed query text, the app's own shared Adzuna credentials, and (for the prefill) the caller's own previously stated preferences, never a value belonging to anyone else.

**Configuration required**:

- `ADZUNA_APP_ID`: server only, required (`z.string().min(1)`, no default), Adzuna's application id credential.
- `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`: server only, required (`z.string().min(1)`, no default), Adzuna's application key credential.

Both are added to `.env.example` and `.env.test.example` (both already exist in this repo) as part of Build plan step 1, with placeholder values, matching every other credential already documented there.

Country, currency, and the attribution domain are plain code constants, not environment variables: they carry no secret and do not vary by deploy environment.

**Critical test scenarios**:

- Happy path: a signed in user with a `job_preference` row searches with a real title, sees real Adzuna listings with working attribution and outbound links, verifies **AC-1**, **AC-6**, **AC-8**.
- Failure case: Adzuna forced to time out and, separately, forced to return a malformed body, each renders the failure state and reports the matching kind, verifies **AC-5**.
- Failure case: Adzuna forced to return a non success HTTP status (e.g. a `429`), renders the same failure state and reports `external_service_failed`, verifies **AC-5**.
- Failure case: a batch where one of several returned listings fails its own item level parse renders the rest normally and drops only the bad one, verifies **AC-1**, **AC-5** (the "every item fails" branch is a separate case, same kind).
- Gate: a caller whose account week cap is already spent gets the exact `account_week_cap_reached` sentence and no Adzuna call runs, verifies **AC-3**, **AC-10**.
- Gate failure: `checkUsageGate()` itself forced to fail (an invalid session, or a forced database error) renders the failure state through `session_missing` or `database_unavailable` respectively, never the refusal state, verifies **AC-3**.
- Validation: a submission with both fields blank is refused before any call and spends no budget, verifies **AC-2**.
- Empty: a search that legitimately matches nothing renders the empty state, distinguishable from both the failure and refusal states, verifies **AC-4**.
- Predicted salary: a listing carrying `salary_is_predicted: true` renders the estimate label and the Jobsworth attribution; one carrying `false` (or no salary) renders neither, verifies **AC-7**.
- Prefill without spend: a caller with a `job_preference` row visits bare `/search` (no `q`/`where`), sees the fields prefilled, and neither `checkUsageGate()` nor the Adzuna client is called, verifies **AC-9**.

## Build plan

Ordered for Tracer Bullet: a thin thread through every layer proven on one real query before the full attribution and edge case surface is built out.

_Progress, 2026-09-04: steps 1 to 7 are built and landed on `feat/job-search-and-results-list`. Step 8 is **not** done: the whole thread was proved end to end by hand against the real local stack and the real Adzuna API (a real minted session, 20 real listings, and each of the five visible states driven in a browser), but no recorded Adzuna fixture and no committed test of the Critical test scenarios exists yet. That is `/test`'s milestone on this feature's scope row._

1. Configuration: add `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY` (both required) to `src/env.ts`'s server block and to `.env.example`/`.env.test.example`, and add the `adzuna` entry to `DATA_RECIPIENTS` in `src/features/legal/recipients.ts` naming both keys. Satisfies **AC-11**.
2. Build `src/lib/usage-gating/with-usage-gate.ts`: the `withUsageGate<T>(callType, fn, cookieAdapter?)` inversion of control helper spec 0011's own Consequences flagged as owed to this feature, returning `Result<{ allowed: true, value: T } or { allowed: false, reason: UsageGateReason }>` (see Decision), so a caller cannot reach its outbound call without the gate's `allowed: true` branch running it. Threads the same optional `cookieAdapter` seam `checkUsageGate()` already exposes, so the real minted session tests in step 8 have something to pass. Lives in `src/lib/` alongside the rest of usage gating, not under this feature, since it is generic across call types. Satisfies **AC-3**, **AC-10**.
3. Build `src/features/search/adzuna.ts`: the Zod schemas (the envelope, the per item listing shape parsed individually per the Data model sketch's drop and count rule, and the `SearchQuery` input requiring at least one of title or location), the `source` constant, the `Listing` type, and `searchListings()` (accepting the same optional `cookieAdapter`), opening the `search.run` span as its first statement, building the request from the named endpoint/`results_per_page`/timeout constants, checking `res.ok` explicitly before parsing (a non success status is `external_service_failed`, never handed to the parser), wrapping the `fetch` in `attempt()` for a thrown network error, and calling `withUsageGate("job_search", ...)` around it. Register `search.run` in `docs/observability/spans.md`. Satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-2**, **AC-5**, **AC-10**.
4. The thin end to end thread: `src/features/search/search-form.tsx` (the plain `GET` form) and repoint `src/app/(app)/search/page.tsx` off its placeholder to read `searchParams`, call `searchListings()`, and render real listings through `Card`/`Card.Footer`, with a plain text attribution stand in until the real logo lands. Proves the whole pipe, gate through render, on one real query. Satisfies **AC-1**, **AC-8** (partial).
5. Thicken: the `AdzunaAttribution` component (the real logo asset once sourced, both link targets) placed in `Card.Footer`'s `attribution` slot, and the Jobsworth badge (icon, text, link, mouseover) shown beside a predicted salary, plus the "(estimated)" label. Satisfies **AC-6**, **AC-7**, **AC-8**.
6. Thicken: the prefill read from `job_preference` on a bare `/search` visit (never itself calling `searchListings()`), its own failure notice (`COPY-6`, added at revision 3), and the three distinct visible states (validation message, empty state, failure state), rendering `COPY-3` through `COPY-5` from the Copy table above. Satisfies **AC-4**, **AC-9**.
7. Retire the entry page's `filtered search` planned claim to working (spec 0006, AC-8, the status card). Satisfies **AC-12**.
8. Prove and test: the Critical test scenarios above, against a real minted session (spec 0004) and a recorded Adzuna fixture (redacting `ADZUNA_APP_ID`/`ADZUNA_APP_KEY` at capture time, per spec 0004's own redaction rule). Satisfies every AC.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

- The entry page's "filtered search" claim becomes true the moment this ships, the third of five features 32's status card held a slot open for.
- `withUsageGate()` closes a gap spec 0011 itself flagged rather than engineered around, and becomes reusable by features 13 and 14 when they add their own call types.
- The attribution slot spec 0005 built ahead of time gets its first real content, closing that spec's own Follow-up.

**Negative / tradeoffs**:

- Adzuna's search response carries only a description snippet, not the full posting text. Scoring (feature 14) and the remote heuristic (feature 18) inherit that limitation; this spec does not resolve it, `docs/archive/jobhunt-carry-forward.md`'s feature 14 entry already names the options.
- The Jobsworth attribution adds a second, visually distinct attribution block whenever a predicted salary appears, which is most listings in practice; the result card is busier than a plain job board card as a direct consequence of meeting the terms exactly rather than approximately.
- Locking the country to a single constant means a second market is a code change, not a configuration change, until a real second market is actually needed.
- A reload, a shared `/search?q=...` link, or a browser back navigation each spends a fresh gate check and, if allowed, a fresh Adzuna call (AC-10), since the URL alone drives the render and this app keeps no cache of its own to serve a repeat view from. At this app's real volume this is not a meaningful cost, but it is a real one, and it means the account weekly cap of 25 is a cap on requests, not on distinct intents to search.

  **`next dev` hides this, and the gap is worth knowing before it fools somebody else.** On a development server a back navigation costs nothing, because the browser answers it from its own HTTP cache and never asks the app. That is not this app's doing and it is not a bug: `next dev` deliberately sends `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` so back and forward feel instant while you work (Next 16.3.1, `base-server.js`, and its own comment beside that line says exactly this). **A production build sends `private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate` instead**, measured on 2026-09-04 from `pnpm build && pnpm start`. `no-store` means the response is never stored, so back really does return to the server, and really does spend.

  Both halves were measured on the same day rather than reasoned about: under `pnpm dev`, one load plus one back moved the counter by one; under `pnpm start`, the same two steps moved it by two. **Production is the number that counts**, so AC-10 states the production behaviour and asks to be verified against a production build. The development behaviour is recorded here only so that a future reader who measures it in `next dev` and sees a free back navigation knows why, and does not "correct" this spec on the strength of it. That already happened once, on the day this feature was verified; the first Follow-up item tells that story, because the shape of the mistake is more useful than the fact.

- **The prefill now has four outcomes where the first build had three**, and one of them costs a sentence nobody would have written from the acceptance criteria as first drafted: preferences found, no preferences stated, and the read failing, which used to collapse into the second. The cost is small and the shape is worth naming, because it generalises. Any read whose empty result is itself meaningful needs the failure told apart from the emptiness, and the criterion has to say so, or an implementer satisfies the criterion exactly and still ships a silent failure. That is what happened here: the early return was correct about not blocking the form and wrong about saying nothing.

**Neutral**:

- No migration. This is the first Slice 1 feature that adds no table and no policy.
- The real Adzuna logo asset is a manual step outside this spec's own build plan (see Follow-up); the thin thread ships with a text only stand in until it lands.

## Follow-up

- [x] The real Adzuna logo image asset must be sourced by the engineer before step 5 of the Build plan; none was found at the pages this spec's research reached (`adzuna.co.uk/press.html` returned 403 Forbidden on 2026-09-04). **Done: the engineer supplied it before the build** (`src/features/search/adzuna-logo.svg`, commit `1504a0b`), so AC-6 is met in full, with the mark rendered inline from `adzuna-logo-geometry.ts` and held to the file by a drift test.
- [x] **The spec was right about back navigation, a verify run "disproved" it, and the disproof was the thing that was wrong.** Worth keeping in full, because every step looked reasonable. On 2026-09-04 `/check verify` measured a back navigation costing nothing and reported the spec's claim as false. `/architect` then rewrote AC-10, Consequences and `rationale.md`'s con to match, explaining it as the browser's back and forward cache. A cross check on a different model refused the explanation and found the hole: the measurement ran under `pnpm dev`, and `next dev` deliberately sends `Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate` so the browser can answer back and forward from its HTTP cache, while a production build sends `no-store` and back really does return to the server. Re measured against `pnpm build && pnpm start` the same day: one load plus one back spent two. **The original spec was correct and has been restored.**

  Three lessons, in the order they bite. **A measurement is only evidence about the thing measured**; `next dev` and a deployed build are different systems, and a performance affordance in one of them is not behaviour of the other. **A correction deserves the scrutiny the original claim got**, which is why this project's own reflex asks for a re review after a material revision; here that reflex is the only reason the wrong correction did not ship. And **the second explanation was worse than the first**: the original claim was a plain deduction that happened to be right, while the correction dressed a dev only artifact in a confident mechanism (bfcache) that was not even the mechanism at work. Confidence tracked the wrong thing both times.
- [x] **A failed prefill read rendered as "no preferences stated", and AC-9 as first written permitted it.** Found by `/check review` on 2026-09-04, on Fable 5. The implementation was not careless: it caught the failure, let the reader keep typing, and relied on `failure()` having already reported to Sentry, which it had. The gap was that reporting is not telling. Empty fields were AC-9's own definition of "no stated preference", so the failure quietly borrowed a meaning that belonged to something else, and the caller who did state preferences saw them gone with no way to tell which had happened. Fixed the same day: AC-9 now says blank fields may mean only the one thing, `COPY-6` says the other out loud, and the page test that had locked in "no alerts on this branch" was replaced by two that pin the two screens apart. **The reusable part is the criterion, not the code**: a criterion that names a visible state without saying what makes it true can be met exactly and still be wrong.
- [ ] `COPY-1` through `COPY-5` still read _to be written_ in the Copy table above, while the approved sentences have lived in `src/features/search/copy.ts` since the build. `COPY-6` was written into the table directly at revision 3, which makes the inconsistency visible rather than uniform. Worth back filling the five the next time this spec is touched, so the table is either the source or plainly not, rather than half of each.
- [x] Spec 0005's own Follow-up (index line 180, confirm the exact attribution image asset and link targets) is now answered in full and has been ticked there. **This item was already stale when written**: it said spec 0005 "stays as written until the asset lands", while this spec's own first Follow-up item records that the asset had already landed (`src/features/search/adzuna-logo.svg`, commit `1504a0b`). Closed at feature 11's close out on 2026-09-04, which also corrected spec 0005's line 86: it described the link targets as "adzuna.co.uk for Jobs, the Adzuna logo image for Adzuna", and both halves are wrong. The verified targets are `https://www.adzuna.com` for both the word and the mark, for the configured United States country, and the `.co.uk` address belongs to the separate Jobsworth attribution, not to this one.
- [ ] If this app is ever configured for a country other than the United States, review the currency constant, the attribution domain constant, and the Jobsworth link target together: the Jobsworth URL is quoted in this spec exactly as Adzuna's terms state it, with no "or relevant local domain" alternative offered the way the main attribution clause has, so treat it as fixed rather than assumed to vary per country until checked again.
- [ ] Whether Adzuna grants a rate limit increase on request, and on what terms, is unverified (also flagged in `docs/archive/jobhunt-carry-forward.md`'s feature 10 entry); worth asking before spec 0011's own caps are treated as permanently fixed to Adzuna's current defaults.
- [ ] `docs/scope/scope.md`'s Done when wording for this feature ("every screen showing listings carries the required attribution label") is close enough to build against but not quite accurate: the verified obligation is per displayed advert, not per screen. Worth a small wording correction next time `/scope` reconciles.
- [x] Spec 0003's `application` table sketch (index line 118) describes `job_description` as "the listing's full description text ... the only copy that survives the posting being taken down." That is now known incorrect: Adzuna's search response carries only a snippet (confirmed directly against the API docs, 2026-09-04), so whatever feature 12 eventually writes into `job_description` will be a snippet too, unless a future feature adds a separate fetch of the full posting. Worth a small correction to spec 0003's column note so a later reader is not misled about what actually survives. · **Done 2026-09-05, and this item was itself incomplete.** It named line 118 only. Spec 0003 stated the claim TWICE: line 118's column note, and line 262's Consequences line saying `job_description` "stores a full listing body per application". A grep for "full description" or "full text" finds the first and misses the second, which is how the second survived being written down as an error. **Both are corrected**, and feature 12 writes `descriptionSnippet` into the column (spec [0014](../0014-apply-redirect-and-application-record/index.md), AC-12).
- [x] **`Listing.salaryIsPredicted` has nowhere to land.** Confirmed directly against `supabase/migrations/20260825162457_data_model.sql:168` to `188`: `application` carries `salary_min`, `salary_max`, `salary_currency`, and no column for whether the figure was predicted. If feature 12 snapshots a `Listing` straight into `application` as the table stands today, AC-7's "(estimated)" label silently disappears the moment a user applies to a predicted salary listing, and every later screen reading from `application` (an applications dashboard, feature 23) would show it as a stated figure. This spec does not resolve it, since the table belongs to spec 0003 and the write belongs to feature 12, neither of which this spec owns. My own lean, for feature 12's spec to weigh rather than inherit as settled: add the column (a small, additive migration) rather than drop the flag on snapshot, since dropping it directly contradicts the reason AC-7 exists. Recorded identically in spec 0003's own Follow-up and on feature 12's scope row so it survives until a feature 12 spec exists to decide it properly. · **Resolved 2026-09-05.** Spec [0014](../0014-apply-redirect-and-application-record/index.md) AC-6 weighed the lean above rather than inheriting it, and agreed with it: the column was added, not the flag dropped. The deliberation added what the lean had not considered, that the column must be NULLABLE, because Adzuna sends the flag on every advert including ones quoting no pay, so writing the boolean straight through would have stamped `false` on rows with no salary at all. Migration `20260905120000_application_salary_is_predicted.sql`, with `application_predicted_pairing` refusing both halves of the mistake.
