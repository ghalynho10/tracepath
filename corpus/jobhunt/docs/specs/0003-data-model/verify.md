# Verify: data model · spec 0003 · updated 2026-08-25

_Steps derived from spec 0003 acceptance criteria. `/check verify` runs these; `/test` locks the durable ones._

## What has been proved, and where

**Development, 2026-08-25, on pull request [#9](https://github.com/ghalynho10/JobHunt/pull/9). Everything below passed except the two criteria that belong to the second pull request.**

- The whole **Commands** section ran as [verify.sql](verify.sql) against the **hosted development project**, one result set, zero failures. It had already passed identically against the local database.
- The three **UI / manual** sign in steps were driven on the real preview deployment: dev-one and dev-two each saw only their own profile, and dev-three, who has no profile row on purpose, saw the named `record_not_found` failure rather than an empty page.

`verify.sql` is safe to re run at any time. It does not depend on a rollback: every
successful write happens under a throwaway user that the last cascade test deletes, and
every refused write undoes itself. The final `clean` lines confirm the fixtures are
untouched.

**Production, 2026-08-25. AC-16 and AC-13 closed, in that order and on purpose.**

- Pull request #9 merged, its production migration run succeeded, and the production deployment built from that merge went live on `usejobhunt.vercel.app`. [verify-production.sql](verify-production.sql) confirmed the six tables, forced row level security, the twenty three policies and the privilege gate on the production database. That is **AC-16**, and only then was the drop written.
- Pull request [#10](https://github.com/ghalynho10/JobHunt/pull/10) dropped `scaffold_check`, merged as `3a56243`, its production migration run succeeded, and `verify-production.sql` then reported `scaffold_check on this database: gone`. Local and development report the same. That is **AC-13**.

All sixteen acceptance criteria are proved. Re run [verify-production.sql](verify-production.sql)
against any environment at any time: it is read only and safe on production.

Two acceptance criteria are deliberately **not** reachable in this pull request. AC-13 and
AC-16 are the drop of `scaffold_check`, and the drop belongs in a second pull request that
may only be written after production is confirmed serving `readOwnProfile()`. Anyone
closing them from a green preview has misread the gate.

## Commands

Run against the target database. Locally: `docker exec -i supabase_db_jobhunt psql -U postgres -d postgres`.

- [x] All six tables exist in `public` with the specced columns, types and nullability → `select table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable from information_schema.columns where table_schema='public' and table_name in ('profile','profile_skill','work_experience','job_preference','application','application_answer') order by 1,2;` matches the spec's data model sketch → AC-1
- [x] Row level security is enabled **and forced** on all six → `select relname, relrowsecurity, relforcerowsecurity from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid=c.relnamespace where n.nspname='public';` every one is `t/t` → AC-2
- [x] Twenty three policies, four per table and three on `profile_skill` → `select tablename, count(*) from pg_policies where schemaname='public' group by 1;` → AC-2
- [x] Each policy carries the clause its action permits: `select`/`delete` have `using` only, `insert` has `with check` only, `update` has both → `select tablename, cmd, qual is not null as has_using, with_check is not null as has_with_check from pg_policies where schemaname='public' order by 1,2;` → AC-4
- [x] `authenticated` holds exactly the specced privileges and `anon` and `service_role` hold **nothing** on all six → `has_table_privilege` sweep over the three roles and six tables → AC-2
- [x] A query as `anon` is refused with a hard permission denial, not an empty result → `set local role anon; select 1 from public.profile;` raises `42501 permission denied for table profile` → AC-2
- [x] The constraint sweep below is refused at every line → AC-4, AC-7, AC-8, AC-9, AC-10, AC-11
- [x] `updated_at` is the trigger's, not the caller's → `update public.profile set full_name='x', updated_at='2000-01-01' where id=<a user>;` then read it back: it holds the transaction time, not the year 2000 → AC-12
- [x] Deleting the auth user empties all six for that user → seed a row in each of the six, `delete from auth.users where id=<user>`, then count across all six: zero → AC-5
- [x] A user deleting their own `profile` empties the same subtree while the auth account remains → as that user `delete from public.profile where id=<self>`, count across the six is zero and `auth.users` still holds them → AC-6
- [x] `pnpm db:types` output matches the applied schema and the tree typechecks → `pnpm db:types && pnpm typecheck` clean, no diff left in `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` → AC-15
- [x] `scaffold_check` is gone from local, development and production, nothing references it in code, its seed rows are gone and its span line is off the registry → `select to_regclass('public.scaffold_check');` is null locally; on production, the engineer ran [verify-production.sql](verify-production.sql) directly and its last line reads `scaffold_check on this database: gone`; GitHub Actions confirms the same drop migration also succeeded against development at 2026-08-25T19:00:08Z; `grep -r scaffold_check` finds nothing outside migration history and historical prose → AC-13 · **second pull request only**

### The constraint sweep

Each statement must be **refused**. Run as the owning user unless the line says otherwise.

```sql
-- AC-4, the with check clause, as dev-one
insert into public.work_experience (profile_id, company, title, started_on)
  values ('<dev-two>', 'Sneaky Co', 'Engineer', '2024-01-01');            -- 42501
update public.work_experience set profile_id = '<dev-two>' where id = '<own row>'; -- 42501

-- AC-7, the same listing applied to twice
insert into public.application (profile_id, source, source_job_id, job_title, company_name, job_url)
  values ('<dev-one>', 'adzuna', 'job-1', 'Engineer', 'Test Co', 'https://example.test/job-1'); -- 23505 on the second

-- AC-8, run as the OWNER so row level security is bypassed and the foreign key
-- is the only thing left to refuse it. As `authenticated` the insert policy
-- denies it first and the test passes without exercising the foreign key.
insert into public.application (profile_id, source, source_job_id, job_title, company_name, job_url)
  values ('<a profile that does not exist>', 'adzuna', 'job-2', 'E', 'C', 'https://example.test/2'); -- 23503
insert into public.application_answer (application_id, profile_id, question_key, answer)
  values ('<dev-one application>', '<dev-two>', 'why', 'Not mine.');      -- 23503, the composite key

-- AC-9, pay is raw, paired and ordered, in BOTH tables
... salary_min 50000 with no salary_currency                              -- 23514
... salary_currency 'EUR' with no figure at all                           -- 23514
... salary_min 90000 with salary_max 50000                                -- 23514
... salary_currency 'eur' lowercase                                       -- 23514
... job_preference minimum_pay 40000 with no minimum_pay_currency         -- 23514
... job_preference remote_preference 'from_the_moon'                      -- 23514

-- AC-10, a skill is unique per profile ignoring case
insert into public.profile_skill (profile_id, name) values ('<dev-one>', 'React');  -- accepted
insert into public.profile_skill (profile_id, name) values ('<dev-one>', 'react');  -- 23505
insert into public.profile_skill (profile_id, name) values ('<dev-two>', 'react');  -- accepted, different profile

-- AC-11, work history dates
... started_on '2024-01-15', a day other than the first                   -- 23514
... ended_on '2024-06-15', a day other than the first                     -- 23514
... started_on '2024-06-01' with ended_on '2024-01-01'                    -- 23514
... started_on '2025-03-01' with no ended_on, meaning current             -- accepted
```

One trap worth naming, because a test can pass for the wrong reason here. An **update
aimed at another user's existing row** is not refused, it changes **zero rows**: the
`using` clause hides the row and no error is raised. That is correct and safe, and it is
not what AC-4 claims. AC-4 is about **placing a row under another user's profile**, which
is the `with check` clause, and that one does raise `42501`. Assert the row count and the
victim row's contents, never just the absence of an exception.

## UI / manual

Run on a real preview deployment, which reads the hosted development project. A local run
proves the code; only the preview proves the deployment.

- [x] Sign in as `dev-one@example.test` → `/health` shows that user's own profile (name, location, summary) and their auth user id → AC-3, AC-14
- [x] Sign in as `dev-two@example.test` → `/health` shows a **different** profile, and never dev-one's line → AC-3, AC-14
- [x] Sign in as `dev-three@example.test`, who has no profile row on purpose → `/health` shows a named failure, kind `record_not_found`, severity `expected`, in a `role="alert"` block, and never an empty page → AC-14
- [x] The failure block above is reachable by keyboard and announced: it carries `role="alert"` and readable text, not colour alone → AC-14
- [x] Production is serving `readOwnProfile()` and its migration run succeeded, confirmed on the production URL and in the migration workflow, **before** the drop migration is written → AC-16 · migration ordering confirmed via GitHub Actions: `Apply migrations (production)` succeeded for pull request #9's merge commit `8fcb672` at 2026-08-25T17:36:19Z, and pull request #10 (the drop) was not built until after, its own head commit only reaching `Apply migrations (development)` success at 19:00:08Z. Schema confirmed directly: the engineer ran [verify-production.sql](verify-production.sql) against production and pasted the result on 2026-08-25, all lines `pass`, zero `FAIL`. No signed in click through exists to add on top of this: production carries 0 profile rows (confirmed in the same query output) because feature 7 (real auth) is not built yet, so no account exists to sign in with. The schema query plus the migration record is the achievable ceiling for this gate today, and matches exactly what pull request #10's own body names as the three conditions it waited on.

## Value sourcing

One per row of the spec's Value sourcing table, so a value that is sourced from the wrong
place is caught even when the shape is right.

- [x] `profile.id` comes from `auth.uid()` and never a supplied value → as dev-one, `insert into public.profile (id, full_name) values ('<dev-two>', 'X')` is refused `42501` → AC-4
- [x] `full_name`, `location`, `summary` on a real write come from feature 9's form, parsed by Zod first, with the Zod rules mirroring the check constraints → **feature 9 owns this**; today assert only that the database refuses what Zod would: a blank or whitespace `full_name`, and a `full_name` over 200 characters, are both `23514` → AC-1
- [x] The seed fixture's profile values are literal strings in `supabase/seed.sql`, obviously fake, and subject to the same checks a real write is → `pnpm db:reset` succeeds with the fixture in place, and no fixture value is a real personal identifier → AC-3
- [x] `created_at` and `updated_at` come from the database default and the shared trigger, never from a caller → insert with no timestamps supplied and both are populated; see also the AC-12 command above → AC-12
- [x] The profile the health page shows is selected **by policy**, not by an application filter → confirm `src/features/profile/queries.ts` carries no `eq` on the caller's id, then re run the two user isolation steps above. If a filter is ever added, AC-3 stops proving anything → AC-3, AC-14
- [x] The "no profile yet" state comes from `record_not_found`, returned when the select matches no row → the dev-three step above → AC-14
- [x] An application's `profile_id` comes from `auth.uid()` → covered by the AC-4 sweep → AC-4
- [x] An application's `source` is the constant `adzuna`, set server side and never by the browser → any other value is refused `23514`; **feature 11 owns setting it** → AC-1
- [ ] The listing snapshot fields come from the listing object feature 11 parsed → **feature 11 and 12 own this**; today assert only that all of `source_job_id`, `job_title`, `company_name`, `job_location`, `job_url`, `job_description`, `posted_at`, `salary_min`, `salary_max`, `salary_currency` exist and accept a full listing → AC-1
- [x] `applied_at` comes from the database default, and is distinct from `created_at` → insert with neither supplied, both populate, and the column pair is genuinely two columns → AC-1
- [x] The duplicate refusal comes from the unique constraint, not from a caller side check → the AC-7 line above, run with no prior select → AC-7
- [ ] `question_key` comes from feature 20's preset set → **feature 20 owns the check constraint**; today the column only refuses blank → AC-1
- [x] An answer's `profile_id` is the parent application's, and any other value is refused by the composite foreign key → the second AC-8 line above → AC-8
- [x] Scoring reads `profile_skill.name` rows for the caller → **feature 14 owns this**; today assert a user sees only their own skills → AC-3
- [x] The privacy notice's list of stored personal fields matches the spec's data model sketch → **feature 21 owns this**; today assert the sketch and the applied schema agree, which is the AC-1 command above → AC-1
