# 0008. App shell and navigation, rationale

The reasoning behind [index.md](index.md). `/develop` does not read this file.

**Revision 5, 2026-08-31.** The chosen option is unchanged. A sub decision on
who composes the header is added below, recording why per page composition
beat the three alternatives, including the parallel route slot that would
have preserved the original wording.

**Revision 2, 2026-08-31.** The chosen option is unchanged. The sub decision on
where the return path is carried is reversed, after the cross model review in
[docs/reviews/2026-08-31-spec-0008-app-shell-and-navigation.md](../../reviews/2026-08-31-spec-0008-app-shell-and-navigation.md)
found that the proxy written cookie broke the two tests that are binding rule
6's only mechanical guard. The variant this file already recorded is now the
chosen mechanism. See the sub decision below, which is rewritten.

## Context

> ⚠️ **Premise note: the scope row's own done when clause contains one wording
that this spec amends.** Scope feature 32 says "a user with no profile row
lands on `/profile` and everyone else on `/`". Both `scope.md` and
[docs/archive/app-shell-direction.md](../../archive/app-shell-direction.md) predate section 1
of the direction document, which resolved the search route as `/search`
because spec 0006's accepted security model makes `/` a static page that reads
nothing. Landing a signed in user on the marketing page is the same bug the
sign in invitation is: the app's own front door sending people who already
have an account to a page that invites them to create one. The engineer
confirmed the default landing is `/search`, and this spec carries the
amendment rather than inheriting the stale wording. Everything else in the
done when clause is adopted as written.

The app has no shell. Three features were each about to invent one: feature 9
needs a page to put the profile form on, feature 11 needs a page for results,
feature 12 needs a place for the application record to live. The gap is named
in the scope as feature 32, enrolled deliberately ahead of feature 9, and the
direction document already settled most of the inventory. What remained
genuinely open was the sign in invitation on `/`, the return path through
sign in, and the exact mechanics of the landing rule.

Four forces shape the answer.

**The first is a contract already Accepted.** Spec 0006's security model says
`/` is "public and reads nothing. No session check, no Supabase client, no
Server Action, no user data of any kind", and its AC-4 pins the consequence:
zero client JavaScript, statically prerendered, with an automated test that
fails if any file the page reaches carries `"use client"`. Any fix for the
invitation that makes `/` read the session amends an Accepted contract, which
nothing in this feature is entitled to do. The fix has to come from outside
the page.

**The second is binding rule 6.** The proxy decides no authorisation and, as
written, only refreshes the session cookie. The return path needs a component
that both knows the requested path and may write a cookie, and the design
conversation verified the two obvious candidates are not buildable: a Server
Component cannot set a cookie (Next.js throws during render), and a layout
never learns the requested path (layouts receive params and children, never
the pathname). That leaves the proxy, which already runs on every route and
already holds the cookie writing machinery.

**The third is the project's error model.** A silent success is worse than a
loud failure. Applied here it rules out the sign in band's "coming soon"
phrasing returning anywhere (spec 0007 **AC-16** deleted it once it became
false), rules out placeholder pages wearing the health page's failure
treatment, and rules out a deep link being silently discarded when it could
have been honoured.

**The fourth is scale by subtraction.** Spec 0003's decisions fix the
inventory: no dashboard in v1 (feature 23 is v1.5), no saved results (feature
11's results are fresh per search), and the application record is the only
place a job persists. A signed in user can do three things, so the inventory
is three routes. The shell is thin because the app is thin, not because it
was left unfinished, and the spec says so deliberately so a later reader does
not "complete" it out of habit.

Not deciding is the one option that fails everything. Features 9, 11 and 12
are blocked on a decided shell, and the invitation bug ships with every day
it stays undecided.

## Options considered

### Option 1: Thin shell with a neutral door (chosen)

Three routes under `(app)` with a shared header varied by route group, no
mobile menu machinery, one shared landing rule, the return path carried in a
proxy written cookie, and a small GET route handler outside `src/app/api/`
that reads the session and sends the visitor to the landing rule or to
`/sign-in`. On `/`, the sign in band's provider forms are replaced by one
neutral CTA pointing at the door.

**Pros**:

- Every accepted contract survives intact: `/` stays static and session free,
  binding rule 6's substance holds, spec 0007's safeguards stand.
- The invitation is removed for real, not hidden: a signed in visitor sees a
  door into the app, and a signed out visitor's extra hop is one click.
- The return loop is one thread through components that already exist (proxy,
  callback, server client), so the build is small and testable end to end.

**Cons**:

- The proxy takes on a second job, widening binding rule 6's wording.
- Signed out visitors lose one click provider buttons on `/`.

### Option 2: Make `/` session aware

Amend spec 0006: `/` reads the session and renders the invitation or an app
entry depending on who is asking.

**Pros**:

- One page, one render, no extra hop for anyone, no new route.

**Cons**:

- Directly amends an Accepted contract, including the automated AC-4 test
  that exists to fail on exactly this change.
- Forces the marketing page dynamic, paying a session read on every visit by
  every visitor, including the anonymous majority it exists for.

### Option 3: Client hint cookie

Sign in sets a plain `signed_in=1` cookie; a small client component on `/`
hides the invitation when it sees the cookie.

**Pros**:

- `/` stays static; the change is small and entirely presentational.

**Cons**:

- The hint lies in both directions. A stale cookie hides the invitation from
  someone actually signed out, a silent failure in the project's own terms,
  and a visitor can forge or clear it at will.
- Puts session adjacent logic in a client component, against the rule that no
  session check runs in the browser.

### Option 4: Proxy rewrite for `/`

The proxy sends a visitor with a live session from `/` to `/search`.

**Pros**:

- No new route; the invitation disappears because signed in visitors never
  render `/` at all.

**Cons**:

- The proxy would branch on the session state to decide what a request to a
  public page returns, which is an authorisation shaped decision in exactly
  the file binding rule 6 forbids it.
- Removes the only place a signed in visitor can deliberately revisit the
  marketing page, and rewrites on every request rather than on one CTA.

**Sub decision: where the return path is carried.** Rewritten in revision 2.

Two facts fence this decision, both verified against
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. A Server Component cannot set a cookie
(`cookies.md` line 81), and a layout never learns the requested pathname
(`layout.md` lines 180 and 238 to 242). So the component that knows the path
and the component that may write the cookie are never the same component, and
the path has to be handed from one to the other.

**Revision 1 chose the proxy written cookie** and was wrong, for a reason the
design conversation did not surface and the cross model review did. Spec 0001
line 133 does not say the proxy decides no authorisation and stop there. It
says the proxy "refreshes the Supabase session cookie **and does nothing
else**", a closed enumeration, and two tests enforce it:
`src/proxy.test.ts` lines 49 to 62 assert the proxy treats a protected route
exactly as it treats a public one, and lines 64 to 70 assert it sets no
cookies. A proxy that recorded a return cookie for `(app)` paths would have
had to break both. That is not a wording problem. It is the same "amends an
Accepted contract" objection this file uses to reject Option 2, and applying
it to Option 2 while waiving it here was the inconsistency the review caught.
It also carried a second flaw: `src/proxy.ts` rebuilds `response` inside
Supabase's `setAll` callback, so a cookie written before the session touch
would have vanished on exactly the most common deep link case, an expired
session, silently.

**Revision 2 chooses the variant this file previously recorded and dismissed
in a clause.** The proxy sets a request header carrying the pathname on every
request, unconditionally and with no route knowledge at all; the `(app)`
layout reads it through `headers()` at the moment it already redirects, and
appends it as `?next=`; `/sign-in` carries the accepted value into a hidden
field; the provider Server Action validates it and writes the cookie before
leaving for the provider; the callback reads, validates, redirects and clears.

It wins on three counts that are not close. The proxy never learns what
`(app)` means, so there is no hand maintained route list to drift, which was
the third severe finding. Both proxy tests stay true unmodified, because
setting a request header on every request is still not telling a protected
route from a public one, and is still not writing a cookie. And the cookie
write moves to a component that is unambiguously allowed to make it
(`cookies.md` lines 6 and 74), which removes the `setAll` hazard entirely.
Binding rule 6 still needs a dated amendment, because "does nothing else" is
still an enumeration and the proxy now does one more thing. But the amendment
shrinks to "echoes the requested path as a request header", and the guard the
rule actually exists for survives unbroken rather than being deleted.

**What it costs, stated plainly.** The return path becomes visible and user
supplied in the `?next=` parameter, where the cookie kept it opaque. Anyone
can send a victim `/sign-in?next=<anything>`. That is a real widening of the
threat surface and it is why the validator now runs at all three boundaries
the value crosses rather than once, following the parse at every boundary
rule instead of trusting an earlier parse. It also touches three components
instead of two. Both were judged worth paying to keep binding rule 6's tests
intact.

**One mechanic is inferred rather than verified**: that a `Set-Cookie` written
in a Server Action survives that same action's `redirect()` to an external
URL. Server Functions may set cookies and the existing action already
redirects off-site, so only the combination is unproven, and the docs do not
address it. Build step 1 exists to prove it before anything is built on it,
and a fallback is recorded in the spec's Consequences: the provider forms post
to a route handler, which may unambiguously write a cookie and redirect.

Either way `redirectTo` stays untouched, so spec 0007's safeguard 3 holds
under both revisions.

**Sub decision: the default landing.** `/search`, not `/`, per the premise
note. The runner up was keeping the scope row's literal wording, rejected
because inheriting a stale contradiction is how specs calcify; spec 0007
already flagged its own literal `/health` callback redirect as "the single
most likely thing here to calcify by accident", and this feature replaces it.

**Sub decision: header tap targets.** Keep the sizes the design system locks
(above the WCAG 2.2 AA 24px floor of SC 2.5.8, measured 32px and 28px in the
mock up). The runner up, raising to the 44px AAA comfort tier, was rejected
because the project has not committed to AAA and the shell reuses Button
sizes the design system already governs.

**Sub decision: who composes the header.** Rewritten in revision 5, after the
build found the two criteria could not both hold.

Revision 4 fixed this on the marketing side and left the signed in side
saying the `(app)` layout composes the header once. AC-5 asks each route to
pass its own `aria-current="page"` in, and says explicitly that no component
computes it. A layout never learns the pathname (`layout.md` lines 238 to
242), so a header composed in the `(app)` layout can never be told which page
it is on. The two are not merely in tension, they are exclusive.

Four ways out were weighed on 2026-08-31, with the engineer choosing the
first:

**Chosen: each route composes it.** Four one line call sites, `current`
passed at composition time exactly as AC-5 asks, no pathname read anywhere,
and the same shape the marketing side already uses.

**The cost is real, and an earlier draft of this paragraph understated it.**
That draft said the risk was a later route forgetting the header, and called
it mitigated by `app-header.test.ts` plus the `verify.md` walk. The cross
check on 2026-08-31 showed both halves were wrong, and the correction is kept
here rather than quietly deleted:

- `app-header.test.ts` calls `AppHeader` directly with props written in the
  test. It proves the component renders `aria-current` correctly when given a
  value. **It never touches the four call sites**, so it cannot fail when one
  of them is wrong. No test under `src/app/(app)/` exists at all.
- The dangerous failure is not the one that draft named. A **missing** header
  is obvious on sight. A **wrong** `current`, say `/profile` shipping
  `current="search"` after a copy and paste, renders a page that looks
  entirely correct while `aria-current="page"` points a screen reader user at
  the wrong item. That is silent, and it is the same class of harm this file
  uses to reject the `usePathname()` option, so the argument as first written
  undercut itself.

Per route composition is still the right call, because AC-5's wording
forecloses every alternative and the cross check confirmed the four options
are exhaustive. But it is chosen **in spite of** this cost, not because the
cost is small, and today the only thing standing between a wrong `current`
and production is the one time browser walk recorded in `verify.md`. Closing
that is a page level test asserting each route passes its own value, named in
`## Follow-up`.

**Rejected: the layout composes it and `aria-current` is dropped.** This keeps
the original AC-3a wording and pays for it by removing the current page marker
from the navigation, which is a WCAG 2.2 AA affordance this project committed
to. Trading an accessibility affordance to preserve a sentence is the wrong
way round.

**Rejected: the layout composes it and a client component computes
`aria-current` from `usePathname()`.** This works, and unlike the marketing
side it breaks no zero JavaScript contract, since `/sign-in` is not involved.
It was still rejected: it contradicts AC-5's "rather than any component
computing it" outright, and it puts the first client boundary in the signed in
shell to solve a problem that one prop solves. A client boundary is a thing
you spend once and keep forever.

**Rejected: a parallel route slot.** This is the option that would have kept
the layout composing the header while still varying per route, so it deserved
a real look rather than a dismissal. Next.js supports named slots with the
`@folder` convention, passed to the parent layout as props
(`parallel-routes.md`), so an `@header` slot with one page per route would let
`(app)/layout.tsx` render `{header}` and still get a per route value. It was
rejected on cost, verified in that same file rather than assumed: an unmatched
slot on a hard navigation renders `default.js`, **or a 404 if there is none**,
and `children` needs its own `default.js` too. For four routes that is six
extra files, a 404 as the failure mode of forgetting one, and the header
turned into a routing concern, which is exactly what AC-3 forbids of the
primitive. It is the same per route decision wearing a layout costume, at
several times the price.

The lesson worth keeping is not about headers. Revision 4 caught this exact
constraint on one side of the same criterion and did not check the other half
of its own sentence. A criterion that says "differs by side" is a criterion to
read twice.

**Sub decision: placeholder treatment.** Ordinary expected state, one honest
sentence per route, no alert role, no red border, no "coming soon". The
runner up, routes with no pages until their features land, was rejected
because the nav would link to failures.

## Rationale

Option 1 wins because it is the only option that satisfies every standing
contract while still removing the invitation for real. Option 2 buys
simplicity by amending the one Accepted decision this project has an automated
test guarding, which is not simplicity but debt with a test attached. Option
3 and Option 4 each break a rule the project has already paid for: the client
hint reintroduces the silent failure the error model exists to prevent, and
the proxy rewrite puts an authorisation shaped branch into the one file whose
single job is to never make one.

The mechanics follow from the constraints rather than from taste. The return
cookie lives in the proxy because the proxy is the only component that both
knows the path and may write a cookie, and it stays authorisation blind by
writing unconditionally. SameSite is Lax rather than Strict because the
return leg from a provider is a cross site navigation and Strict would
silently disable the feature it exists to enable. The validator is stricter
than "starts with a slash" because browsers normalise `/\evil.com` to a
protocol relative URL and strip embedded control characters, so each hostile
shape is named in the unit test rather than trusted to a rule of thumb. The
query string survives because `/search?q=react` is the deep link most worth
carrying, and a path only rule would land the user on an empty search.

The shape of the shell follows the direction document as the settled
decision, and the design conversation only had to add what the document
genuinely left open. Nothing in the navigation competes with the design
system's elevated idiom, because at three routes there is almost no
navigation. Feature 14's gate layers onto the landing rule's callers rather
than replacing it, which is stated as an invariant here so the gate cannot
grow into the onboarding flow the direction document explicitly ruled out.

- Open redirect defence (unvalidated redirects named by OWASP as a redirect risk), applied through the strict Zod validator and its hostile string test.
- Parse at every boundary, this project's standing rule, applied to the return cookie as untrusted input.
- Progressive disclosure of chrome: the shell stays minimal by construction because the v1 decisions fix the inventory, recorded deliberately so thinness is not read as incompleteness.
