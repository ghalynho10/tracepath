# Verify: design system & UI foundation · spec 0005 · updated 2026-08-27
_Steps derived from spec 0005 acceptance criteria. `/check verify` runs these; `/test` locks the durable ones._

All UI steps run against `/ui-preview`, which renders every base component at
every variant. Set `UI_PREVIEW_ENABLED=true` in `.env.local` first, or the route
404s by design.

## Commands

- [ ] **THIS STEP IS WRONG, REPLACE IT.** It expects 0 matches for `bg-primary-300`, which was only true in the window before `Chip` existed. `Chip` state `matched` uses that class legitimately, so the step now reports a false alarm. Replace with a canary that lives only in the prototype: `pnpm build`, then grep the emitted stylesheet under `.next/static/chunks/*.css` for `12.5px` → expect **0 matches** (`text-[12.5px]` appears in `docs/design/` and never in `src`), proving Tailwind still scans only `src`. Corrected form run on 2026-08-27: 0 matches, and 0 for `mono-label`, `.eyebrow` and `data-reveal` too  → AC-1
- [x] `printf '%s' 'export function P(){return <div className="rounded-2xl border border-line p-6"/>}' > src/app/probe.tsx && npx eslint src/app/probe.tsx; rm src/app/probe.tsx` → expect the `no-restricted-syntax` error naming `Card`. A pass here means the rule has gone vacuous  → AC-15
- [x] `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` → all green  → AC-15
- [x] Remove `UI_PREVIEW_ENABLED` from `.env.local`, `pnpm build`, `PORT=3111 pnpm start`, then `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' localhost:3111/ui-preview` → expect **404**, and `/` still **200**

## UI / manual

Run at 1440px unless a step says otherwise.

- [x] Read the computed `font-size` of each register on `/ui-preview` → expect exactly: `h1` 64px, `h2` 30px, `h3` 20px, eyebrow 12px, `monoLabel` 13px, `monoData` 13px, tertiary button 17px. **Do not eyeball this**: the failure mode is `tailwind-merge` silently dropping a custom `text-*` size as if it were a colour, which renders every register at body size and still looks deliberate  → AC-2, AC-6
- [x] Read the computed `color` of the tertiary button → expect `rgb(25, 70, 70)` (`primary-800`), not ink. Same failure mode as above, in the other direction  → AC-6, AC-15
- [x] Narrow the window below 640px and re-read body `font-size` → expect 17px above the breakpoint and 16px below it  → AC-2
- [x] Confirm the eyebrow labels ("YOUR MATCH", "MATCHED", "MISSING") render in tracked sans caps, and the salary line and the skill gap notes render in mono → the two registers must not be swapped  → AC-6
- [x] Compare the two cards in the 60/40 grid → the left is shadow led with a hint of border, the right is border led with no shadow. Neither carries both  → AC-3
- [x] Confirm the left column is visibly wider than the right at `lg`, and that both stack to one column below it  → AC-8
- [x] Count the cells in both match bars → expect 6 filled + 2 outline, and 8 filled + 3 outline, on the same page from the same component  → AC-7
- [x] Walk the four sections top to bottom → expect three distinct vertical rhythms, `paper` then `sunken` then `sunken` then `paper`, with a hairline divider ONLY between the two adjacent `sunken` sections  → AC-4, AC-5
- [x] Confirm no element animates on load. The match cell stagger is the only motion, and it runs once  → AC-9
- [x] Confirm all five icons render: check, dashed gap circle, GitHub, Google (in its four brand colours), external link  → AC-11

### Keyboard and focus

- [x] Tab from the top of `/ui-preview` to the bottom → expect 8 stops in visual order, each with a 2px teal (`rgb(41, 115, 115)`) ring at 2px offset, and the disabled button skipped  → AC-13
- [x] Read the computed `outline-color` in the same tick as focusing a control → expect the full teal immediately, not a partly faded value. A fade means `outline-color` has crept back into the button's `transition-property`  → AC-13
- [x] Confirm every control has an accessible name (`aria-label` or visible text)  → AC-13

### Media preferences

- [x] Emulate `prefers-contrast: more` → expect `--line` and `--muted` to both become `#474a51`, and the eyebrow, the divider and the missing match cells to darken with them  → AC-12
- [x] Emulate `forced-colors: active` → expect both cards to keep a visible border (the elevated card's shadow is discarded, so the border is its only edge), and the matched cells to stay distinguishable from the missing cells by fill  → AC-12
- [x] Emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, then read the opacity of EVERY match cell within the first frame after load → expect all of them already opaque, and every cell's computed `animation-delay` to be `0s`. Checking the duration alone is not enough and it is what let a real bug through: see the correction below  → AC-9, AC-12 · re-run 2026-08-28 against the fixed stylesheet, all eight cells opaque at the first measurable point and every delay `0s`, with the stagger confirmed still intact when motion is not restricted

> **This step was wrong until 2026-08-28, and it passed while the product was broken.** It asked only whether the animation DURATION collapsed. It did, so the box was ticked. But the reduce block zeroed the duration and not the delay, and `match-cell` is declared with the `both` fill mode, so each cell held the keyframe's `from` state (`opacity: 0`) for the length of its delay. Measured under `reduce` before the fix: five of eight cells still invisible 120ms after load, the last arriving 350ms in. A reader asking for less motion got the same staggered arrival with the smoothing removed. Found during feature 6's browser pass, fixed by adding `animation-delay: 0s !important` (and `transition-delay: 0s !important`) to the block in `src/app/globals.css`, and locked by [globals.test.ts](../../../src/app/globals.test.ts). The lesson is in the step's shape, not just its result: it checked the property the code set, rather than the outcome the preference asks for, so it could only ever confirm what was already believed.

### Responsive

- [x] At 320px, confirm zero horizontal overflow on every element under `main`  → AC-14
- [x] At 320px, confirm the card footer stacks (attribution below the action) and the attribution block measures exactly 116 by 23 pixels. Adzuna's terms make this a licensing floor, not a layout preference, so a compressed block is a real failure  → AC-10, AC-14
- [x] At 1440px, confirm the same footer is a single `justify-between` row  → AC-10

## Not covered here

- The real Adzuna attribution content and its two link targets. This feature builds the slot only; feature 11 supplies the asset and the links, and owns verifying them against Adzuna's terms.
- `MatchBar`'s `matched` and `total` sources. Both are always caller supplied, from the scoring feature (feature 14) or fixture data, so there is no source to verify at this layer.
